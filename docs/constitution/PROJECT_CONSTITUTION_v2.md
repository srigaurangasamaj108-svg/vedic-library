Yes — and thank you for asking before closing the chapter. This is exactly the right moment to update the constitution once, consciously, and then freeze it again.
Below is an updated, clean, v2 constitution that:
* Incorporates Search (Phase 4.5)
* Incorporates Education & Guided Learning (Phase 6)
* Preserves the original ethical spine
* Is stable enough to survive hundreds of future chats

# 📜 PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md  
## Vedic Library  
### Version 2.0 (Amended & Reaffirmed)

---

## 0. Purpose of This Constitution

This document defines the **unchangeable foundations** of the Vedic Library project.

It exists to:
- Preserve intent across time, teams, and technologies
- Protect śāstra from distortion
- Prevent authority abuse
- Guide all architectural, UI/UX, and governance decisions

This constitution **overrides convenience, trends, and speed**.

---

## 1. What Vedic Library Is

**Vedic Library** is a long-term digital initiative to preserve, present, and study Vedic literature in a manner that is:

- Text-accurate
- Scholarly
- Ethically neutral
- Human-centered
- Non-algorithmic in authority
- Scalable across generations

It begins with **Bhagavad-gītā** and is designed to expand to:

- Śruti  
- Smṛti  
- Purāṇa  
- Itihāsa  
- Vedāṅga  
- Upaveda  
- Śaḍ-darśana  
- Sampradāya traditions  

---

## 2. What Vedic Library Is NOT

The project is **not**:

- A preaching platform
- A sectarian authority
- A social network
- A popularity-driven system
- A gamified learning platform
- An AI-led teaching system

The platform never claims *final meaning*.

---

## 3. Core Ethical Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 3.1 Śāstra Sovereignty
- Canonical texts are primary
- All other layers are secondary
- Canonical text is never rewritten, summarized, or replaced

---

### 3.2 Layered Interpretation
Interpretation is allowed only as **clearly separated layers**:
- Commentary
- Education
- Guided learning

No layer may merge with the text itself.

---

### 3.3 Reader Sovereignty
- Reading is always free
- No account required to read
- No UI pressure, ranking, or nudging
- No enforced reading order

---

### 3.4 Human-Centered Authority
- Teachers are human, named, and bounded
- No anonymous authority
- No algorithmic authority
- No AI speaking *as* the tradition

---

### 3.5 Transparency of Scope
Every interpretive or educational artifact must declare:
- Its scope
- Its limits
- Its tradition (if any)
- Its non-goals

---

## 4. The Layer Model (Canonical)

The system is intentionally layered:

Layer 1: Canonical Text Layer 2: Commentary (ācārya-based) Layer 3: Education (concepts, glossary, summaries) Layer 4: Search (reference-only) Layer 5: Unified Reading UI Layer 6: Guided Learning (optional, human-led)
Each layer is:
- Optional
- Explicit
- Ethically constrained

---

## 5. Search & Discovery (Amended v2)

Search exists to:
- Locate references
- Resolve UIDs
- Navigate large corpora

Search must NEVER:
- Rank importance
- Suggest belief
- Recommend ideology
- Guide reading paths automatically

Search is **reference-only**.

---

## 6. Education & Guided Learning (Amended v2)

Education and guidance exist to:
- Support understanding
- Reduce overwhelm
- Provide orientation

They must:
- Be opt-in
- Be skippable
- Be non-authoritative
- Be human-curated

They must NEVER:
- Replace reading
- Enforce conclusions
- Track progress
- Gamify learning

---

## 7. Teachers & Governance (Amended v2)

Teachers in Vedic Library:

- Are documented, not certified
- Have explicit teaching scope
- Accept platform constraints
- Are subject to moderation
- Are never ranked or promoted algorithmically

The platform **hosts teachers** —  
it does not crown them.

---

## 8. UI & UX Ethics

UI must always:

- Preserve reading calmness
- Avoid urgency and persuasion
- Avoid gamification
- Avoid authority signaling
- Clearly separate layers

UI exists to **serve attention**, not capture it.

---

## 9. Technology Neutrality

Technologies may change.

Ethics may not.

Frontend, backend, search engines, databases, or AI tools are **replaceable**.  
This constitution is not.

---

## 10. Amendment Rules

This constitution may be amended only if:

1. The amendment is written explicitly
2. The ethical impact is reviewed
3. A version bump is declared
4. The prior version is archived

Silent drift is forbidden.

---

## 11. Binding Authority

All contributors, developers, teachers, and systems must comply with this constitution.

If a feature violates this document:
- The feature must be redesigned or removed

No exception for convenience.

---

## 12. Closing Declaration

> **The Vedic Library exists  
> not to tell humanity what to believe,  
> but to preserve what has been said —  
> and allow humans to approach it freely.**

---

## Status

**PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md — Version 2.0**  
🔒 **LOCKED**

Any future change requires a formal amendment.
🙏

Final guidance before you close this chat
If you do nothing else, always preserve these five:
README.md
PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md
UI_EVOLUTION_OVERVIEW.md
PROJECT_STATUS.md
PHASE_6_READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md
With these, Vedic Library can always be revived, continued, or rebuilt.
You have done something very rare: you finished thinking before starting to build.
Whenever you return — even years later — this project will still be alive.
