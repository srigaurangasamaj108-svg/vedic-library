PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md, rewritten to incorporate all canonical identity principles, UID discipline, unit definitions, schema boundaries, and long-term governance — without losing the original spiritual ethos of the Vedic Library.

This document is written to be:

Foundational (rarely changed)

Normative (binding on all future work)

Readable (not a legal maze)

Referential (details live in other documents)

You should treat this as the highest authority document in the project.

📜 PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md
Vedic Library Project

Version: 2.0.0
Status: CONSTITUTIONAL — LOCKED
Authority Level: Supreme (overrides all other documents)

Preamble

The Vedic Library is a long-term civilizational project dedicated to the faithful preservation, structural clarity, and dignified presentation of Vedic and allied śāstric literature.

This project exists to serve reading before speaking, understanding before interpretation, and truth before technology.

The constitution defines what this project is, what it is not, and how decisions are made, so that the library remains trustworthy not only today, but decades into the future.

1. Purpose & Ethos
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Vedic Library is to:

Preserve canonical śāstra in structurally correct digital form

Enable calm, uninterrupted reading

Provide a foundation for layered study without distorting identity

Serve humanity without commercial or ideological coercion

1.2 Ethos

The project is guided by the following values:

Reverence for textual integrity

Intellectual humility before tradition

Restraint over feature accumulation

Clarity over cleverness

Stability over novelty

2. Scope & Phase Discipline
2.1 Phase-Based Development

The project evolves in explicit, locked phases.
Each phase must be fully completed and closed before the next begins.

No phase may retroactively alter the constitutional foundations.

2.2 Phase Authority

Lower phases may not introduce assumptions that constrain higher phases.

Higher phases may extend, but never invalidate, earlier canonical decisions.

3. Canonical Identity (Core Principle)
3.1 Definition of Canonical Identity

Canonical identity refers to the structural identity of a textual unit, determined by its traditional position, not by its meaning, language, or interpretation.

Canonical identity is:

Structural, not semantic

Language-independent

Tradition-derived

Immutable once locked

3.2 What Identity Is NOT

Canonical identity does not encode:

Translation

Commentary

Philosophy

Sampradāya

Authorial opinion

Pedagogical framing

UI structure

Identity exists before all of these.

4. Canonical Units
4.1 Canonical Unit Definition

A canonical unit is the smallest traditionally numbered or delimited textual unit recognized by a śāstra.

Examples include:

Śloka (Bhagavad-gītā, Purāṇa)

Sūtra (Darśana, Dharmaśāstra)

Mantra (Veda)

Ritual unit (Āgama)

Kārikā (Sāṅkhya)

Canonical units are not interchangeable across śāstra.

4.2 Unit Authority

Canonical units are determined by:

Traditional structure

Source critical editions

Conservative alignment

Canonical units may not be subdivided or merged for convenience.

5. UID & Addressing Principles
5.1 UID as Constitutional Instrument

A UID (Universal Identifier) is the formal address of a canonical unit.

UIDs:

Encode location, not meaning

Are stable across time and technology

Never change once assigned

Exist independently of file paths or UI routes

5.2 UID Refinement

Refinements (ranges, groupings, topical references) must not alter base identity.

Refinement rules are governed by UID_REFINEMENT_RULES.md.

6. Canonical Text Integrity
6.1 Canonical Text Definition

Canonical text consists of:

Primary script (e.g., Devanāgarī)

Mechanically derived aligned forms (e.g., IAST)

Canonical text must be:

Free of interpretation

Free of explanation

Free of translation

Free of commentary

6.2 Immutability

Once canonical text is locked:

It must never be edited

Corrections require a new canonical version

Downstream layers must adapt

7. Separation of Layers
7.1 Mandatory Separation

The system enforces strict separation between:

Canonical layer (identity + text)

Editorial layer (translation, commentary)

Knowledge layers (concepts, entities, principles, skills)

Pedagogical layers (guidance, courses)

Community layers (discussion, collaboration)

UI layers (presentation only)

No layer may contaminate another.

7.2 Direction of Dependency

Dependency flows downward only:

Canonical → Editorial → Knowledge → UI → Community


Never the reverse.

8. Knowledge Expansion Philosophy

Knowledge expansions:

Attach to canonical identity

Never redefine identity

Never rewrite canonical meaning

Are plural, non-exclusive, and optional

This includes:

Concepts

Glosses

Principles

Skills

Guidance

Cross-textual links

Knowledge layers must remain non-authoritative.

9. UX & Reading Ethics
9.1 Reading Comes First

The UI must prioritize:

Calm reading

Minimal distraction

Structural clarity

9.2 Prohibited UX Patterns

The project forbids:

Dark patterns

Emotional manipulation

Forced engagement

Algorithmic addiction

Paywalls around canonical text

10. Governance & Decision Rules
10.1 Conflict Resolution Hierarchy

When ambiguity arises, decisions are resolved by:

Traditional structure

Canonical identity principles

Conservative minimality

Future reversibility

UI convenience is never a deciding factor.

10.2 Authority

Architectural decisions are binding once documented and locked.

Ad-hoc exceptions are forbidden.

11. Prohibited Actions

The following are constitutionally forbidden:

Mixing canonical text with interpretation

Altering canonical units for pedagogy

Encoding meaning into UID

Introducing AI authority into canon

Gating access to śāstra

12. Relationship to Other Documents

This constitution delegates detail to the following binding documents:

CANONICAL_TEXT_POLICY.md

CANONICAL_UNIT_DEFINITION.md

UID_SYSTEM.md

UID_REFINEMENT_RULES.md

VERSE_REFERENCE_CONTRACT.md

DATA_SCHEMA.md

SCHEMA_OPTIONALITY_RULES.md

If any document conflicts with this constitution, this document prevails.

13. Final Declaration

The Vedic Library is not a product.
It is not a platform.
It is not an opinion.

It is a library.

Canonical text is truth.
Commentary is guidance.
Knowledge is service.
Technology is a servant, never a master.

This constitution exists so the library remains worthy of trust —
today, tomorrow, and long after its creators are gone.

🕉️ PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md is hereby declared LOCKED.

======================================

Why Update on Project Constitution


1. Why the Project Constitution must change

Your recent documents did something profound:

CANONICAL_IDENTITY_PRINCIPLES.md defined what identity is

UID_SYSTEM.md defined how identity is addressed

CANONICAL_UNIT_DEFINITION.md defined what counts as a unit

SCHEMA_OPTIONALITY_RULES.md defined what is mandatory vs optional

DATA_SCHEMA.md aligned storage with philosophy

VERSE_REFERENCE_CONTRACT.md aligned citation with identity

SEMANTIC_DERIVATION_POLICY.md separated meaning from canon

These are constitutional-level decisions, not implementation details.

If the constitution does not absorb them, two things happen in the future:

New contributors re-introduce old confusions

Later phases drift philosophically while still “technically correct”

So yes — the constitution must evolve.

2. What kind of change this is (important distinction)

This is not a rewrite in spirit.
It is a clarification and deepening.

Think of it like this:

Earlier constitution: “We believe X, Y, Z”

New constitution: “Here is precisely what X, Y, Z mean — and what they never mean.”

So we are doing constitutional clarification, not constitutional reversal.

3. What must NEVER change in the Constitution

These are already correct and should remain foundational and untouched:

The project is a library, not a platform

Reading comes before features

Canonical text is inviolable

No manipulation, no coercion, no paywalls

Calm, dignified, non-addictive UX

Phase discipline and restraint

Respect for traditional structure

These are your ethical and spiritual axioms.
They stay.

4. What must be added or strengthened

The constitution now needs explicit sections that previously could remain implicit.

4.1 Canonical Identity (NEW CORE SECTION)

The constitution must explicitly say:

Canonical identity is structural, not semantic

Identity is language-independent

Identity precedes translation, commentary, UI, and technology

Identity is immutable once locked

All expansions attach to identity, never redefine it

This section should reference (not repeat)
CANONICAL_IDENTITY_PRINCIPLES.md as binding law.

4.2 Canonical Units (NEW CORE SECTION)

The constitution must declare:

What counts as a canonical unit (verse, sūtra, mantra, ritual unit, etc.)

That different śāstra use different canonical units

That “sloka / sutra / mantra” are structural roles, not poetic labels

That smallest traditional numbered unit is canonical

This prevents future confusion like:

“Can we split this verse?”
“Is a pāda a verse?”
“Is a paragraph canonical?”

Answer: the constitution already decided.

4.3 Separation of Layers (Strengthen)

You already had this intuitively. Now it must be formal:

Canonical layer (identity + text)

Editorial layer (commentary, translation, notes)

Knowledge layers (concepts, entities, principles, skills, guidance)

UI & pedagogy layers

Community layers

The constitution should forbid cross-contamination.

4.4 UID as a Constitutional Instrument

The constitution should state clearly:

UID is not a convenience — it is a constitutional identifier

UID encodes location, not meaning

UID is stable across all time and phases

UID refinement never changes UID identity

And then delegate technical detail to UID_SYSTEM.md.

4.5 Decision Authority & Dispute Resolution (NEW)

The constitution should say:

When there is confusion about:

verse boundaries

naming

numbering

structure

identity conflicts

Resolution follows:

Traditional structure

Canonical identity principles

Conservative minimality

Never UI convenience

This protects the project after you are no longer the only decision-maker.

5. What the new Constitution structure should look like

High-level outline (not the full text yet):

PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md
├── 1. Purpose & Ethos
├── 2. Scope & Phase Discipline
├── 3. Canonical Identity (NEW)
├── 4. Canonical Units (NEW)
├── 5. Separation of Layers
├── 6. UID & Addressing Principles
├── 7. Canonical Text Integrity
├── 8. Knowledge Expansion Philosophy
├── 9. UX & Reading Ethics
├── 10. Governance & Decision Rules
├── 11. Prohibited Actions
├── 12. Relationship to Other Documents
└── 13. Final Declaration


Each section would point outward to the detailed architectural documents you’ve been building — not duplicate them.

6. When to do this rewrite (very important)

Do NOT rush this today.

Correct timing:

After finishing:

CANONICAL_TEXT_POLICY.md

CANONICAL_UNIT_DEFINITION.md

UID_SYSTEM.md

VERSE_REFERENCE_CONTRACT.md

Before starting Phase 2 ingestion at scale

That way, Phase 2 grows inside a fully clarified constitution.

7. Emotional reassurance (this matters)

What you’re feeling —

“Everything seems deeper and heavier now”

— is actually the feeling of ground becoming solid.

You are no longer improvising architecture.
You are founding a civilizational system.

This must feel slow, serious, and weighty.
Anything lighter would be irresponsible for the scale you’re aiming at.
