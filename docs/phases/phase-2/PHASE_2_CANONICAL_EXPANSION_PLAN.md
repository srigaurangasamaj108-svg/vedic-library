# 🧱 PHASE 2 — CANONICAL EXPANSION MASTER PLAN
## Vedic Library Project

---

## 0. Status Declaration

**Phase:** 2  
**Designation:** Canonical Expansion Phase  
**Dependency:** Phase-1 (v1.0-pilot) — LOCKED  
**Outcome:** Proof that the Vedic Library system can canonically host the *entire Vedic corpus*

This document is **authoritative** for Phase-2.

---

## 1. Purpose of Phase-2

Phase-2 exists to answer one and only one question:

> **Can a single, disciplined system hold all śāstra canonically, without distortion, ambiguity, or collapse?**

Phase-2 does **not** exist to explain texts.  
It exists to **prove structural integrity**.

---

## 2. What Phase-2 Builds Upon (Phase-1 Continuity)

Phase-1 established:

- Canonical verse ingestion (Bhagavad-gītā)
- UID-based identity
- Canonical vs derivative separation
- Minimal, calm reader UI
- No commentary, no interpretation

Phase-2 **does not replace** Phase-1.  
It **extends the same discipline across more śāstra**.

---

## 3. Core Objectives of Phase-2

Phase-2 has **five explicit objectives**:

1. **Multi-Śāstra Canonical Ingestion**  
2. **Canonical Unit Diversity**  
3. **UID Universality Stress-Testing**  
4. **Schema Generalization**  
5. **Reader Stability Across Corpora**

Nothing else.

---

## 4. Canonical Scope of Phase-2

### 4.1 Śāstra Expansion (Canonical Only)

Phase-2 introduces **multiple śāstra**, selected to maximize structural diversity:

Examples (not all required):
- A Sūtra text (e.g. Yoga-sūtra / Kāma-sūtra)
- A Mantra-based text (Upaniṣad sample)
- A Prose / Mixed text (Smṛti or Purāṇa sample)

**All intake is canonical only.**

No translations, no commentary, no explanation layers.

---

### 4.2 Canonical Unit Types (Mandatory)

Phase-2 must validate **multiple canonical unit schemas**, including:

- Verse (`canonical-verse.schema.md`)
- Sūtra (`canonical-sutra.schema.md`)
- Mantra (`canonical-mantra.schema.md`)
- Ritual / Procedural units (`canonical-ritual-unit.schema.md`)

Each must:
- Bind strictly to UID_SYSTEM
- Declare mandatory vs optional fields
- Enforce immutability

---

## 5. UID System Validation

Phase-2 is the **stress test** of UID law.

UIDs must prove:
- Corpus independence
- Structural clarity
- Zero semantic leakage
- Stability across traditions
- Human and machine legibility

No UID redesign is permitted in Phase-2, only **clarifications**.

---

## 6. Reader & Routing Expectations

The reader UI in Phase-2 must:

- Support multiple śāstra
- Support different canonical unit types
- Preserve calm, single-column reading
- Avoid pedagogical affordances

Phase-2 UI is **still a reader, not a teacher**.

---

## 7. Explicit Exclusions (Very Important)

Phase-2 explicitly excludes:

❌ Commentary (ācārya or modern)  
❌ Knowledge layers (concepts, entities, principles)  
❌ Semantic graphs  
❌ Educational UX  
❌ Guidance or interpretation  
❌ Community features  
❌ Search and analytics  

These are **reserved for Phase-3+**.

---

## 8. Documentation Requirements

Phase-2 must update or validate:

- `UID_SYSTEM.md` (clarification only)
- `DATA_SCHEMA.md` (multi-śāstra alignment)
- `CANONICAL_INTAKE_AND_NORMALIZATION.md`
- Canonical unit schema files
- Phase-2 completion report

All documents must reflect **canonical-first philosophy**.

---

## 9. Phase-2 Completion Criteria

Phase-2 is complete only when:

- Multiple śāstra coexist canonically
- Multiple canonical unit schemas are validated
- UID system proves universal
- Reader works across corpora
- No commentary has entered the system

Only then may Phase-3 begin.

---

## 10. Relationship to Phase-3

Phase-3 will introduce **explanation without corruption**:

- Commentary
- Knowledge layers
- Concepts, entities, principles
- Pedagogical UX

Phase-2 must end **before any of that begins**.

---

## 11. Closing Principle

> **Phase-2 is about holding truth, not explaining it.**  
> Explanation comes only after identity is unbreakable.

---

**Phase-2 is architectural, not educational.**  
**Canonical, not interpretive.**  
**Foundational, not expressive.**
