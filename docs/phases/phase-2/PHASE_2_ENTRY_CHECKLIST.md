📜 PHASE_2_ENTRY_CHECKLIST.md

Vedic Library Project

Phase: 2 — Canonical Expansion
Status: REQUIRED FOR PHASE-2 ENTRY
Authority: Subordinate to PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md
Change Policy: Amendable only before Phase-2 begins

0. Purpose of This Checklist

This document defines the mandatory readiness conditions that MUST be satisfied before any Phase-2 work begins.

Phase-2 is the canonical expansion phase.
Errors introduced here are irreversible.

This checklist exists to:

Prevent constitutional drift

Prevent premature feature development

Prevent architectural shortcuts

Enable safe parallel work

Protect canonical integrity

Completion of this checklist is not optional.

🔒 A. Constitutional Readiness (ALL REQUIRED)

The following constitutional principles have been read, understood, and accepted.

These principles are defined authoritatively in
docs/constitution/PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md and its delegated documents.

☐ The project is understood to be a library, not a platform or product

☐ Canonical identity is understood as structural, not semantic

☐ Canonical units are understood to be traditionally defined and immutable

☐ UID immutability is understood and accepted as non-negotiable

☐ Separation of layers is understood and respected:

Canonical

Editorial

Knowledge

Pedagogical

UI

☐ AI is understood to be strictly subordinate, never canonical or authoritative

☐ Phase discipline is understood:

Phase-2 must NOT introduce Phase-3 concerns

Authority:
PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md
(and all documents it constitutionally delegates to)

Failure to satisfy any item above disqualifies Phase-2 entry.

🧱 B. Architectural Readiness (ALL REQUIRED)

The architectural contracts governing Phase-2 are finalized, locked, and understood.

☐ CANONICAL_TEXT_POLICY.md is finalized and locked

☐ CANONICAL_UNIT_DEFINITION.md is finalized and locked

☐ UID_SYSTEM.md is finalized and locked

☐ VERSE_REFERENCE_CONTRACT.md is finalized and locked

☐ Canonical schemas are finalized and versioned:

canonical-verse

canonical-sutra (if applicable)

canonical-mantra (if applicable)

canonical-ritual-unit (if applicable)

☐ SCHEMA_OPTIONALITY_RULES.md is finalized

☐ DATA_SCHEMA.md reflects canonical vs derivative separation

No architectural redesign is permitted once Phase-2 begins.

🧬 C. Pipeline & Mapping Readiness (ALL REQUIRED)

The transformation from raw source material to canonical identity is fully governed.

☐ PIPELINE_REGISTRY.md is finalized and versioned

☐ RAW_TO_CANONICAL_MAPPING_POLICY.md is finalized and locked

☐ Canonical data is understood to be:

Script-produced only

Never hand-edited

☐ Provenance requirements are understood and enforced

☐ Validators exist (or are planned) for:

Canonical schema validation

UID validation

Index validation

Raw data is treated as archival, never authoritative.

🧩 D. Phase-2 Scope Discipline (ALL REQUIRED)

The scope of Phase-2 is clearly understood and accepted.

Phase-2 explicitly includes:

☐ Multi-śāstra canonical ingestion

☐ Multiple canonical unit types

☐ UID stress-testing

☐ Schema generalization (non-breaking only)

☐ Minimal reader stability

Phase-2 explicitly excludes:

☐ Commentary

☐ Translation layers

☐ Knowledge graphs

☐ Concepts, entities, principles

☐ Pedagogical UX

☐ Search, analytics, or personalization

☐ Community features

Phase-3 concerns must not leak into Phase-2.

🔀 E. Parallel Work Readiness (REQUIRED IF APPLICABLE)

If Phase-2 work will be parallelized:

☐ A Phase-2 Core Chat exists and is treated as authoritative

☐ Text-specific canonical ingestion chats are defined as:

Mechanical

Non-decisional

☐ Pipeline / script chats are defined as:

Implementation-only

Non-interpretive

☐ Clarification chats are defined as:

Understanding-only

Non-decisional

☐ Cross-chat authority hierarchy is understood

Parallel work must obey:
docs/governance/PARALLEL_WORK_AND_CHAT_PROTOCOL.md

✅ F. Entry Declaration

Phase-2 may begin only when all sections above are satisfied.

By proceeding, contributors affirm:

Canonical integrity is the highest priority

Convenience is never a justification

Phase discipline will be enforced

Canonical mistakes are unacceptable

🕊️ Closing Principle

Phase-2 is about holding śāstra — not explaining it.
If identity is not yet unbreakable, expansion must wait.

This checklist is binding.
Phase-2 begins only once it is complete.
