# 📊 Phase 2 — Status Ledger
## Vedic Library Project

---

## Phase Identity

- **Phase:** 2
- **Name:** Canonical Expansion
- **Depends on:** Phase 1 (v1.0-pilot)
- **Prepares for:** Phase 3 (Interpretive Layers)
- **Current State:** 🟡 ACTIVE (Architectural)

---

## Lock Status

### 🔒 Locked (Inherited)
- Phase-1 canonical Bhagavad-gītā data
- Phase-1 UI snapshot
- UID system (structure only; clarifications allowed)
- Canonical identity principles

### 🔓 Mutable (Phase-2 Scope)
- Canonical ingestion of new śāstra
- Canonical unit schemas (non-breaking clarifications only)
- DATA_SCHEMA.md (multi-śāstra alignment)
- Intake & normalization pipelines
- Reader routing across corpora

---

## Authoritative Phase-2 Documents

The following documents define Phase-2 authority:

- `PHASE_2_CANONICAL_EXPANSION_PLAN.md`
- `PHASE_2_TASKLIST.md`
- `PHASE_2_FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md`
- `README.md` (Phase overview)

Any document not listed here is **non-authoritative** for Phase-2.

---

## Explicit Exclusions (Enforced)

The following are **not permitted** in Phase-2:

- Commentary or bhāṣya data
- Knowledge layers (concepts, entities, principles, guidance)
- Educational or teaching UX
- Search or analytics
- Backend APIs
- User state or persistence
- AI-generated interpretive content

Violations constitute a **phase breach**.

---

## Current Focus

Phase-2 work is currently focused on:

- Canonical intake of structurally diverse śāstra
- Validation of multiple canonical unit types
- Stress-testing UID universality
- Ensuring reader stability across corpora

---

## Next Allowed Action

Proceed with **Phase-2 schema audit**, limited to:

- Canonical unit schemas
- Verse index schema
- Editorial unit schema (structure only, no usage)

No Phase-3 planning or implementation is permitted at this time.

---

## Status Update Rule

This file may be updated **only** when:

- Phase state changes
- Lock status changes
- Phase is formally completed

All updates must be factual and minimal.
