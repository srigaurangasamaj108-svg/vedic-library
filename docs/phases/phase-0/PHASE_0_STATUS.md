# Phase 0 Status Record
## Vedic Library Project

**Phase:** 0  
**Status:** ARCHITECTURALLY COMPLETE  
**Architecture:** FROZEN (Foundational)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document records the **architectural and data-layer completion**
of **Phase 0** of the Vedic Library project.

Phase 0 establishes the **foundational schemas, pipelines, invariants,
and governance principles** upon which all subsequent phases depend.

This record serves as a **reference point**, not a termination of work.

---

## 2. Scope of Phase 0

Phase 0 encompassed the complete design and stabilization of the
project’s foundational layer, including:

- canonical data modeling
- source ingestion and normalization
- editorial authority modeling
- derivative layers (translation, synonyms, exposition)
- verse indexing and routing
- formal schema definitions
- migration pipelines
- validator implementation
- architectural and ethical governance documents

---

## 3. Key Achievements

During Phase 0, the following milestones were achieved:

- Canonical verse layer designed, generated, and validated
- Editorial Unit schema defined and implemented
- Translation, synonyms, and exposition layers stabilized
- Verse Index routing layer completed
- Validator suite implemented and verified
- Migration pipelines executed and documented
- Legacy outputs safely isolated
- Foundational architectural and ethical principles ratified

These outcomes establish a stable and extensible base for all future work.

---

## 4. Frozen Artifacts (Foundational)

The following artifacts are considered **foundational** and are
**frozen by default**:

- `PROJECT_CONSTITUTION_v2.md`
- `PIPELINE_REGISTRY.md`
- Canonical schemas
- Editorial Unit schema
- Validator rules

Any modification to these artifacts requires **explicit review and
formal amendment**, as they define the integrity of the system.

---

## 5. Regeneration Policy

The following layers are **safe to regenerate** at any time:

- normalized source data
- editorial units
- derivative layers
- verse index files

The following elements **must not be regenerated or altered**
without deliberate review:

- canonical verse data
- schema contracts

This distinction preserves stability while allowing iteration.

---

## 6. Readiness Declaration

Phase 0 is declared:

> **Architecturally complete and ready for Phase 1**

All subsequent phases — including UI, search, education, and
multi-ācārya expansion — may proceed **without architectural risk**
to the canonical foundation.

---

## 7. Closing Statement

Phase 0 was dedicated to **thinking correctly before building quickly**.

That objective has been fulfilled.

The system is now prepared for intentional construction,
iteration, and growth.
