# Phase 1 Status Declaration
## Vedic Library Project

**Phase:** 1 — Bhagavad-gītā Pilot (Reading Interface)  
**Version:** v1.0-pilot  
**Status:** COMPLETE & LOCKED

---

## Summary

Phase 1 has been successfully completed.

A calm, faithful, read-only Bhagavad-gītā reader now exists,
fully governed by the architectural and ethical foundations
established in Phase 0.

---

## What Phase 1 Delivered

- Canonical Sanskrit (Devanāgarī)
- IAST transliteration
- Word-for-word synonyms
- English translation
- English purport (Śrīla Prabhupāda)
- Editorial-unit–governed grouping
- Verse-by-verse linear navigation
- Calm, distraction-free UI
- Strict respect for data authority and silence-on-absence

---

## What Phase 1 Explicitly Excludes

- Search
- User accounts
- Donations
- Analytics
- AI features
- Multiple ācāryas
- Learning paths or progress tracking
- Personalization or recommendations

These belong to later phases only.

---

## Lock Declaration

Phase 1 is now **feature-frozen**.

Any change to behavior, scope, or ethics
requires a new phase or a formal amendment
to the project constitution.

---

## Closing Statement

Phase 1 proved that a digital interface
can serve śāstra without distorting it.

This phase is complete.

# Phase 1 Status — Canonical Reader Validation

**Phase:** 1  
**Status:** COMPLETE — LOCKED

---

## Phase Purpose

Phase-1 validated that canonical śāstra data,
as defined in Phase-0, can be rendered and navigated
in a calm, read-only reading interface
without compromising textual identity.

---

## What Was Achieved

- Canonical Bhagavad-gītā ingested and validated
- UID-based routing proven stable
- Verse-atomic rendering enforced
- Reader-first UI validated
- Canonical vs derivative separation preserved

---

## What Phase-1 Did NOT Do

- No new canonical schemas
- No commentary or knowledge layers
- No translations beyond reference data
- No backend APIs
- No user accounts or personalization

---

## Lock Declaration

All Phase-1 documents, data, and UI behavior
are frozen and immutable.

Any future changes must occur in later phases
without modifying Phase-1 artifacts.

---

## Forward Reference

Phase-2 begins canonical expansion across multiple śāstra,
without introducing interpretation or pedagogy.

---

**Phase-1 is complete.**
