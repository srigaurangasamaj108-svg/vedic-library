# Phase 1 Status Declaration
## Vedic Library Project

**Phase:** 1 — Bhagavad-gītā Pilot (Reading Interface)  
**Current Status:** NOT_STARTED  
**Version Target:** v1.0-pilot  

---

## Status Summary

Phase 1 has **not yet begun**.

No frontend framework has been initialized.
No UI code has been written.
No visual rendering exists at this time.

This is intentional and correct.

---

## Preconditions

Phase 1 is authorized to begin because:

- Phase 0 is formally completed and locked
- Canonical data is finalized and validated
- Editorial Units are stable
- Derivative layers are complete and validated
- Verse Index is present and validated
- Pipeline registry is locked
- Schema contracts are defined
- Validators are passing

All architectural prerequisites are satisfied.

---

## What Has *Not* Happened Yet

The following have **not** been done:

- Next.js installation
- Frontend project initialization
- UI component creation
- Routing implementation
- Styling or typography decisions

This ensures Phase 1 begins **cleanly**, without technical debt or confusion.

---

## Authorization Boundary

Phase 1 may proceed only with work that:

- Respects Phase-0 architecture
- Follows the Phase-1 tasklist exactly
- Avoids all explicitly excluded features
- Maintains read-only discipline

Any work outside this scope belongs to a later phase.

---

## Next Action

When ready, Phase 1 may begin with:

> Initializing the frontend project inside `/frontend`
> according to `PHASE_1_TASKLIST.md`.

Until that point, Phase 1 remains **NOT_STARTED** by design.

---

**Declared in calm readiness.**
