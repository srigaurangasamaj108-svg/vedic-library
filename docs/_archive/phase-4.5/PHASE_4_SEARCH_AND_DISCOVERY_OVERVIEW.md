# 🔍 Search & Discovery Overview  
## Vedic Library – Constitutional Addendum

This document formally defines the **Search & Discovery capability** of the
**Vedic Library** project.

Search is introduced **deliberately and ethically**, as a distinct capability,
not as a default feature.

This document does **not** modify or invalidate any previous phase.
It extends the project constitution with clarity and restraint.

## 🧭 Why Search Exists in Vedic Library

Search in Vedic Library exists to:

- Help sincere readers **locate passages**
- Support **study and reference**
- Enable **educational exploration**
- Assist scholars and teachers

Search does **not** exist to:
- Encourage cherry-picking
- Rank verses by popularity
- Replace contemplative reading
- Create algorithmic authority

Search is a **tool**, not a guide.

---

## 🧱 Constitutional Placement of Search

Search is **explicitly excluded** from:

- Phase 1 – Reading
- Phase 2 – Tradition
- Phase 3 – Participation

Search is introduced as:

## **Phase 4.5 – Search & Discovery Layer**

Phase 4.5 is a **sub-phase** that follows Phase 4 (Education & Guidance)
and precedes any community or social features.

This placement is intentional.

---

## 🧠 Why Search Belongs After Education (Phase 4.5)

Before search exists, the platform must already provide:

- Context
- Structure
- Educational framing
- Respect for textual order
- Clear distinction between text, commentary, and guidance

Only then can search:
- Serve understanding
- Avoid misuse
- Remain non-authoritative

Search without education leads to **fragmentation**.
Education before search leads to **clarity**.

## 🔐 Ethical Principles Governing Search

All search functionality must obey the following principles:

1. **Search is optional**
   - No forced search boxes
   - Reading-first UI remains primary

2. **No popularity ranking**
   - No “most searched”
   - No “most viewed”
   - No “trending verses”

3. **No personalization by behavior**
   - Search results not altered by past activity
   - No reader profiling

4. **Transparency**
   - Clear indication of what is being searched
   - Clear separation of text vs commentary results

5. **Respect for śāstra**
   - Search must not imply importance or hierarchy of verses

---

## 🔎 Types of Search (Permitted)

Search is layered, not monolithic.

### 1. Reference Search
- BG 2.13
- Chapter 12
- Verse numbers

Purpose: navigation, not discovery.

---

### 2. Exact Text Search
- Sanskrit (Devanāgarī)
- Transliteration (IAST)
- English
- Hindi

Purpose: locating known passages.

---

### 3. Commentary-Scoped Search
- Search within **one selected ācārya**
- Never mixed by default
- Explicit scope selection required

Purpose: scholarly reference.

---

### 4. Theme-Assisted Discovery (Phase 4.5+)

- Themes prepared in Phase 4
- Search operates *within* thematic boundaries
- Themes guide, search retrieves

Purpose: guided learning, not opinion.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly Forbidden Search Behaviors

The following must **never** be implemented:

❌ Algorithmic relevance scoring that overrides structure  
❌ “Recommended verses”  
❌ Behavioral search personalization  
❌ Search-driven verse ranking  
❌ Cross-ācārya opinion blending  
❌ AI-generated answers presented as śāstra  

If any of these appear, search integrity is broken.

## 🧱 Technology Direction (When Implemented)

Search technology is **not introduced immediately**.
This document only sets direction.

### Recommended Stack (Phase 4.5 onward)

| Layer | Recommendation | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Search Engine | **OpenSearch** | Open, self-hostable, no lock-in |
| Alternative | Elasticsearch | Acceptable if managed |
| Indexing | Backend-controlled | Prevent client misuse |
| Language Analysis | Per-language analyzers | Sanskrit ≠ English |
| Query Control | Explicit scopes | Prevent ambiguity |

Search indices must:
- Mirror UID discipline
- Respect content layers
- Be rebuildable from source JSON

---

## 🧠 Search UI Philosophy

Search UI must:

- Be calm
- Be explicit about scope
- Never dominate the page
- Never replace navigation

Search results must:
- Show verse reference first
- Show context snippet
- Link back to full verse view

Search is an **entry point**, not a destination.

---

## 🧪 Phase 4.5 Success Criteria

Search & Discovery is considered successful when:

- Readers can find verses without confusion
- Search does not replace reading
- Educational paths remain primary
- No verse appears “more important” due to search
- Scholars feel assisted, not directed

---

## 🕉️ Guiding Principle for Search

> **Search retrieves what is asked.  
> It must never decide what should be asked.**

Search serves inquiry.  
It must never shape belief.

---

## 📌 Constitutional Status

This document is:

- Binding for all future search work
- Additive to the project constitution
- Non-retroactive
- Subject to revision only by conscious phase review

---

**Search enters the Vedic Library  
only after humility, context, and education are established.**
