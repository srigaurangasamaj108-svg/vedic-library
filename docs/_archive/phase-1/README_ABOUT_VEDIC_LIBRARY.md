# 游닄 About the Vedic Library Project

**Vedic Library** is a long-term digital initiative dedicated to the faithful preservation, presentation, and study of Vedic literature.

This project is inspired by classical scripture libraries such as Vedabase, while being built independently with modern, open technologies and a calm, disciplined approach to software design.

The goal is simple but serious:  
to make sacred texts available for **peaceful reading, careful study, and future learning**, without distraction or distortion.

## 游 What This Project Is

Vedic Library is:

- A **library**, not a social platform
- A **reading space**, not a content feed
- A **long-term archive**, not a short-term product
- Built with respect for:
  - Textual integrity
  - Traditional structure
  - Scholarly continuity

The project is developed phase by phase, with each phase completed fully before moving forward.

## 游닀 Current Status (Phase 1)

The current version (**v1.0-pilot**) presents the **Bhagavad-g캶t캐** as a complete, read-only digital text.

### Included in Phase 1:
- Verse-by-verse navigation
- Sanskrit 콑loka (Devan캐gar캶)
- Transliteration (IAST)
- Word-by-word synonyms
- English translation and purport
- Hindi translation and purport
- Calm, distraction-free reading experience

### Deliberately excluded in Phase 1:
- User accounts
- Donations
- Search features
- AI-generated interpretations
- Commentary comparisons
- Databases or analytics

This restraint is intentional.  
Phase 1 exists solely to establish **trust and stability**.

## 游빔 How the Project Is Built

The project follows a few core principles:

- **Text comes before technology**
- **Canonical texts are never altered**
- **Translations and commentaries are layered, not mixed**
- **Technology must remain replaceable**
- **Reading experience must remain calm**

All content is structured using stable identifiers so that it can grow across texts, languages, and traditions without breaking.

## 游댩 What Comes Next

Future phases will gradually introduce:

- Multiple 캐c캐rya commentaries
- Additional Vedic texts (콐ruti, Sm攷뜺i, Pur캐攷ㅡ, Itih캐sa, etc.)
- Language expansion
- Educational and thematic study layers
- Optional user accounts
- Voluntary support and donations
- Community and guidance features

Each of these will be introduced **only when the foundation is ready**.

## 游똂 A Note to Readers

Vedic Library is built with the understanding that sacred texts are not content to be consumed quickly, but wisdom to be approached with care.

If this platform helps even one person read more attentively and thoughtfully, it is already fulfilling its purpose.
