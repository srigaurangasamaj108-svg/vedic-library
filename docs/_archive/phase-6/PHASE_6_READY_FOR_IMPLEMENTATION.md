# 🕊️ PHASE_6_READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md  
## Vedic Library Project  
### Formal Declaration — Phase 6

---

## Declaration

**Phase 6 — Courses, Teachers & Guided Study**  
is hereby declared:

> ## ✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

This declaration is made consciously, deliberately, and with full architectural, ethical, and technical preparedness.

---

## Scope of Phase 6 (Recap)

Phase 6 introduces:

- Human-led **Courses**
- Carefully bounded **Teachers**
- Optional **Lessons**
- Soft, non-authoritative **Guided Paths**

All of the above are:
- Opt-in
- UID-anchored
- Transparent in scope
- Non-algorithmic
- Non-gamified
- Subordinate to śāstra

---

## Preconditions — Fully Satisfied

Phase 6 is cleared because **all prerequisites are complete and locked**:

### 1. Canonical Data Architecture
- Course schema ✔
- Lesson schema ✔
- Teacher schema ✔
- Guided Path schema ✔

### 2. UI & UX Discipline
- Phase 6 UI preview ✔
- Phase 6 conceptual wireframes ✔
- Lesson → UI rendering rules ✔
- Zero intrusion into Phase 5 reading UI ✔

### 3. Governance & Ethics
- Teacher onboarding workflow ✔
- Moderation and violation handling ✔
- Explicit authority boundaries ✔

### 4. Implementation Readiness
- Phase 6 task breakdown ✔
- Role definitions ✔
- Integration points identified ✔
- Regression constraints defined ✔

## Non-Negotiable Invariants (Reaffirmed)

During Phase 6 implementation:

- Reading remains sovereign  
- Teachers remain human and bounded  
- Lessons guide attention, not conclusions  
- Paths suggest, never enforce  
- UI never pressures, ranks, or persuades  

If any implementation violates these, it must be rejected.

---

## What Phase 6 Does **Not** Introduce

To prevent ambiguity, Phase 6 explicitly does **not** include:

- AI teaching authority
- Automated guidance
- LMS-style dashboards
- Progress metrics
- Gamification
- Popularity or ranking systems

These remain outside the project’s intent.

---

## Implementation Authorization

From this point forward:

- Developers may begin building Phase 6 features
- Review must reference:
  - Phase 6 schemas
  - Lesson UI rules
  - Teacher moderation policy
- Any deviation requires explicit design review

---

## Cultural Statement

> **Phase 6 marks the moment  
> the Vedic Library opens space for teachers  
> without surrendering the text.**

This balance is the project’s greatest strength.

---

## Status

**PHASE 6 — READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**  
🟢 **Authorized to build**  
🟢 **Governance in place**  
🟢 **Ethics locked**
