Wonderful.
Phase 6 is **not an extension of reading** — it is the **responsible opening of learning**.

Up to Phase 5, the system says:

> *“Read freely.”*

Phase 6 gently adds:

> *“If you wish to learn systematically, here is a path — guided by humans.”*

Below is the **Phase 6 UI Preview**, deliberately framed as a **preview**, not a commitment to implementation details yet.

You may save this exactly as:

# 🧭 PHASE_6_UI_PREVIEW.md  
## Vedic Library Project  
### Phase 6 — Courses, Teachers & Guided Study  
### UI/UX Preview (Conceptual, Not Final)

---

## 0. Purpose of This Document

This document previews the **UI/UX direction for Phase 6**, where the Vedic Library evolves from a *reading environment* into a **guided learning ecosystem**.

It exists to:
- Define *what kind* of learning UI is acceptable
- Set ethical and architectural boundaries early
- Prevent premature LMS-style design
- Preserve śāstra-centric integrity

This is a **preview**, not an implementation guide.

---

## 1. Phase 6 System Intent (High-Level)

Phase 6 introduces:

- Structured courses (optional)
- Human teachers (explicitly identified)
- Guided study paths
- Community learning contexts

Phase 6 does **not** introduce:
- Automated teaching
- AI-driven authority
- Gamification
- Mandatory progression

---

## 2. Core UI/UX Question (Phase 6)

> **“How can guidance be offered  
> without replacing personal inquiry?”**

The UI must always signal:
- *This is a guided option*
- *Not the only way*
- *Not authoritative by default*

---

## 3. Fundamental UI Principle (Non-Negotiable)

### 🔒 Phase 6 UI is **OPT-IN ONLY**

- Courses never auto-appear
- Teachers never overlay reading
- Guided study never replaces free navigation
- Learning UI lives **adjacent to**, not *inside*, the reading flow

---

## 4. New Conceptual UI Areas Introduced

Phase 6 introduces **three new UI zones**, without altering Phase 5 reading UI.

```

Reading Environment (Phase 5)  ← remains untouched
Guided Learning Area           ← new, optional
Community / Mentorship Area   ← new, optional

````

---

## 5. UI AREA 1 — Courses

### 5.1 Course Entry Point (Conceptual)

**Route examples:**
- `/courses`
- `/courses/bhagavad-gita-foundations`

### UI Characteristics
- Courses listed as *offerings*, not recommendations
- Clear teacher attribution
- Clear scope & prerequisites
- No “Start Now” pressure language

---

### 5.2 Course Page Layout (Preview)

```text
Course Title
Teacher(s)
Scope & Intended Audience

[ Course Overview ]

Modules:
• Module 1 – Introduction
• Module 2 – Key Concepts
• Module 3 – Selected Verses

[ Enroll (Optional) ]
````

---

### 5.3 Relationship to Reading UI

* Course links **reference verses**
* Clicking a verse opens the **Phase 5 reading workspace**
* Courses do NOT embed verse text as primary UI

📌 Reading always remains canonical.

---

## 6. UI AREA 2 — Teachers

### 6.1 Teacher Identity (Critical)

Every teacher UI must include:

* Name
* Lineage / background
* Role (teacher, facilitator, mentor)
* Scope of authority (explicitly limited)

---

### 6.2 Teacher Profile Page (Preview)

```text
Teacher Name

Background & Lineage
Teaching Scope
Courses Offered

Statement of Approach
```

📌 No ratings
📌 No popularity metrics
📌 No algorithmic ranking

---

## 7. UI AREA 3 — Guided Study Paths (Human-Curated)

Phase 6 refines Phase 4 guided paths by adding **human stewardship**.

---

### 7.1 Guided Path UI

```text
Guided Path: Bhagavad-gītā for Practitioners

Curated by: [Teacher Name]

Purpose of This Path
Suggested Reading Order
Optional Reflections
```

---

### 7.2 Ethical Guardrails

* Paths are clearly labeled as *suggested*
* No enforcement
* No “completion” pressure
* No scoring

---

## 8. Interaction with Phase 5 UI

### What Does NOT Change

* Sidebar navigation
* Verse workspace
* Context pane behavior
* Search ethics

### What Gets Added

* Links from education → courses
* Links from verse → “Used in course X” (optional, subtle)
* Dedicated learning sections

---

## 9. Accessibility & Calmness (Phase 6)

Phase 6 UI must:

* Avoid dashboards overloaded with metrics
* Avoid progress bars dominating the UI
* Avoid LMS-style “achievement” framing

Learning is framed as **participation**, not performance.

---

## 10. Explicitly Forbidden UI Patterns (Phase 6)

❌ “Recommended for you”
❌ “Top courses”
❌ “Most popular teacher”
❌ AI-generated lesson authority
❌ Auto-enrollment prompts
❌ Intrusive notifications

---

## 11. Long-Term Vision (Beyond Phase 6)

Phase 6 UI prepares the ground for:

* Mentorship circles
* Live study sessions
* Discussion spaces (moderated)
* Community-led learning

All of these remain **human-centered**.

---

## 12. Relationship to Earlier Phases

Phase 6:

* Builds on Phase 4 education
* Uses Phase 5 UI infrastructure
* Respects Phase 4.5 search boundaries
* Does not retroactively alter reading UI

---

## 13. Closing Statement

> **Phase 6 UI does not teach the text.
> It introduces the teacher — and steps aside.**

The Vedic Library remains:

* A library first
* A school second
* A community third

---

## ⚠️ Status

PHASE_6_UI_PREVIEW.md is a **PREVIEW DOCUMENT**.

It defines **direction and boundaries**, not final implementation.

Any Phase 6 development must reference this file.

### 🌿 Where You Are Now

You now possess:

- A complete **UI evolution history**
- A locked **world-class reading environment**
- A **future-facing, ethically constrained learning vision**

Nothing here is rushed.  
Nothing here is naïve.

When you’re ready, the next natural step would be one of these:

1️⃣ Convert Phase 6 preview into **Phase 6 Tasklist**  
2️⃣ Design **Course Data Schemas**  
3️⃣ Pause and let the system breathe  

Just tell me, dear 🙏
