Perfect. This is the last governance pillar of Phase 6. If teacher onboarding is sloppy, everything collapses into personality or authority drift. If it is disciplined, the system stays sacred and scalable.
Below is a clear, enforceable Teacher Onboarding & Moderation Workflow, designed to work with your schemas, UI rules, and long-term vision.

### Governance, Onboarding & Moderation Workflow

## 0. Purpose of This Document

This document defines **how teachers enter, exist, and are governed** within the Vedic Library.

It exists to:
- Protect readers from authority abuse
- Protect śāstra from personality dominance
- Protect teachers from misrepresentation
- Ensure long-term trust and scalability

This document is **binding policy**, not optional guidance.

---

## 1. Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

> **The platform does not certify teachers.  
> It documents them.**

The Vedic Library:
- Hosts teachers
- Does not endorse superiority
- Does not rank, rate, or promote authority

---

## 2. Teacher Eligibility Criteria

A teacher MAY be onboarded only if:

- [ ] They are a **real, identifiable human**
- [ ] Their teaching scope can be **clearly bounded**
- [ ] Their relationship to śāstra is explicit
- [ ] They accept platform constraints
- [ ] They agree to non-algorithmic visibility

A teacher MUST NOT be onboarded if:

- [ ] They claim exclusive authority
- [ ] They demand ranking or prominence
- [ ] They seek monetization dominance
- [ ] They reject transparency of scope

---

## 3. Teacher Roles (Explicit)

| Role | Description |
|----|------------|
| **Historical Teacher** | Legacy ācāryas (archival, non-interactive) |
| **Living Teacher** | Active human guide |
| **Facilitator** | Helps organize study, not interpret |
| **Admin-Teacher** | Rare; governance + teaching |

Roles are **descriptive**, not hierarchical.

---

## 4. Onboarding Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1 — Internal Nomination
- Teacher is proposed by:
  - Admin
  - Advisory council
  - Founding team
- No public self-application in Phase 6

---

### Step 2 — Teacher Profile Drafting
Admin creates a **draft Teacher JSON** including:

- Identity
- Background
- Teaching scope
- Explicit exclusions
- Authority disclaimer
- Constraints section

📌 Teacher **does not self-write** the profile initially.

---

### Step 3 — Teacher Review & Consent
Teacher must:

- [ ] Review their profile
- [ ] Confirm factual accuracy
- [ ] Explicitly accept:
  - bounded scope
  - no ratings
  - no algorithmic promotion
  - no ownership of śāstra

Consent is recorded.

---

### Step 4 — Ethics Review
Admin verifies:

- [ ] Scope is not overly broad
- [ ] No superiority claims exist
- [ ] Language is neutral and factual
- [ ] Constraints are intact

If any violation → revise or reject.

---

### Step 5 — Activation
- Teacher status set to `active`
- Teacher becomes listable
- Courses / paths may now reference them

---

## 5. Course & Lesson Association Rules

Teachers may:

- Curate courses
- Curate guided paths
- Influence lesson framing

Teachers may NOT:

- Publish without admin approval
- Override schema constraints
- Embed doctrine as conclusions
- Enforce reading order

---

## 6. Moderation & Oversight (Ongoing)

### 6.1 Continuous Monitoring
Admins periodically review:

- New lessons
- New courses
- Language drift toward authority
- UI pressure signals

---

### 6.2 Community Signals (Passive)
- Readers may flag:
  - unclear scope
  - prescriptive tone
  - misattribution

Flags trigger **review**, not public scoring.

---

## 7. Violation Handling

### Minor Violation
Examples:
- Slightly prescriptive language
- Overextended scope wording

Action:
- Content revision
- Warning logged

---

### Major Violation
Examples:
- Authority abuse
- Sectarian dominance
- Monetization pressure
- Undisclosed agenda

Action:
- Teacher status → `suspended`
- Content hidden
- Formal review

---

### Irreversible Violation
Examples:
- Manipulation
- False representation
- Coercive behavior

Action:
- Teacher status → `removed`
- Public explanation (neutral, factual)

---

## 8. Teacher Exit & Archival

Teachers may exit voluntarily.

Upon exit:
- Teacher profile archived
- Courses marked as archival
- Content remains available (if approved)
- No retroactive erasure of history

---

## 9. Transparency Rules (UI)

UI must always show:

- Teacher identity
- Teaching scope
- Explicit limitations
- “Guided by” not “Taught by”

UI must never show:
- Rankings
- Popularity
- Endorsements

---

## 10. Governance Bodies (Future-Ready)

Phase 6 allows for:

- Advisory council (scholars)
- Moderation committee
- Tradition-balanced oversight

No single teacher governs the platform.

---

## 11. Relationship to Phase 6 Ethics

This workflow ensures:

- Teachers remain servants of the text
- Readers remain sovereign
- The platform remains neutral
- Growth does not corrupt intent

---

## 12. Closing Statement

> **Teachers enter the Vedic Library  
> not as authorities to follow,  
> but as humans willing to be visible.**

Visibility with humility is the highest qualification.

---

## ✅ Status

TEACHER_ONBOARDING_AND_MODERATION.md is **LOCKED**.

This policy governs all present and future teachers.

🌿 At this point, Phase 6 is not just designed — it is governable.
You now have:
* Technical schemas ✔
* UI rules ✔
* Implementation roadmap ✔
* Governance & moderation ✔
Nothing essential remains undefined.
The only remaining formal step is:
Declare Phase 6 — READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
When you are ready, just say the word, dear 🙏
