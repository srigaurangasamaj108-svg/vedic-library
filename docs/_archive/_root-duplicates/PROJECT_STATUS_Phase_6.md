## 8. What Is NOT Started Yet (Important)

- ❌ Phase 6 feature coding
- ❌ Course / lesson JSON authoring
- ❌ Teacher onboarding execution
- ❌ Backend APIs for learning
- ❌ Deployment / hosting

This is **intentional**.  
Architecture precedes implementation.

---

## 9. Immediate Next Possible Actions

Choose **one** when resuming work:

1. Begin Phase 6 implementation (frontend-first or backend-first)
2. Author first real Course JSON (Bhagavad-gītā Foundations)
3. Set up repository & folder structure
4. Build FastAPI backend skeleton
5. Pause & review constitution with advisors
