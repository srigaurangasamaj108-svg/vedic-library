Backend

FastAPI backend introduced responsibly

User preferences (language, commentary)

Donation records (amount, currency, timestamp)

Phase 2 commentary discipline unchanged

Auth.js boundaries enforced

Backend authority restrained

Scope creep successfully avoided

No further changes belong to Phase 3.
