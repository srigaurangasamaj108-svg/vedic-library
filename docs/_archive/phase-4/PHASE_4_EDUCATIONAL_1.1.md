Very good. Now that **UI behavior is locked**, we can write the text **with the correct tone, length, and restraint**.

Below is the **actual Chapter 1 Introduction text**, written to be:

* Descriptive, not prescriptive
* Contextual, not interpretive
* Calm, not dramatic
* Open-ended, not conclusive

This is **the reference standard** for all future educational writing.

You may store this as:

  "summary": "The first chapter of the Bhagavad-gītā sets the scene for a dialogue that arises not from philosophical curiosity, but from personal crisis. On the battlefield of Kurukṣetra, Arjuna is confronted with the reality that those standing before him as opponents are his own relatives, teachers, and well-wishers.",

  "body": [
    "As the armies assemble, Arjuna asks Kṛṣṇa to place their chariot between the two sides. What he sees there profoundly affects him. Recognizing fathers, grandfathers, cousins, friends, and revered elders, Arjuna’s confidence gives way to sorrow, confusion, and hesitation.",
    "His distress is not merely fear of battle. It is a deeper moral and emotional conflict. Arjuna begins to question the righteousness of fighting a war that will result in the destruction of his own family and teachers. He reflects on duty, compassion, social order, and the consequences of violence.",
    "Physically weakened and mentally overwhelmed, Arjuna lays down his bow and refuses to fight. The chapter closes without resolution. No instruction is yet given, and no philosophy is explained. Instead, the reader is left at the threshold of a conversation that will unfold only because Arjuna openly acknowledges his confusion and helplessness."

## 🧠 Why This Text Is Correct (Important Reflection)

This introduction:

✔ Describes the **situation**, not the solution
✔ Ends with **openness**, not doctrine
✔ Does **not quote later chapters**
✔ Does **not define yoga, bhakti, or jñāna**
✔ Does **not resolve Arjuna’s confusion**
✔ Invites the reader to *continue reading*

Most importantly:

> **It respects the reader’s intelligence and freedom.**

## 🔒 This Text Sets the Standard

From now on, all educational writing must:

* Match this tone
* Match this restraint
* Match this humility

If a future introduction feels “smarter” or “more confident” than this one,
it is likely **crossing a boundary**.

### Next calm step (choose one):

1️⃣ Design UI behavior for **Chapter Summaries**
2️⃣ Draft **Chapter 1 Summary** text
3️⃣ Pause and review Phase 4 alignment (recommended)

Just tell me the number, dear 🙏
