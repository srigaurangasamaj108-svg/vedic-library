Excellent. Below is the **first Guided Reading Path**, written to **strictly obey** the UI behavior, ethical boundaries, and Phase 4 discipline we have locked.

This path is:

* Suggestive, not prescriptive
* Gentle, not exhaustive
* Narrative-first, not doctrinal
* Ideal for a sincere first-time reader

## 🧠 Why This Reading Path Is Correct

This path:

✔ Starts with narrative context (Chapter 1)
✔ Introduces dialogue gradually (Chapter 2)
✔ Avoids doctrinal clustering
✔ Spreads themes naturally across chapters
✔ Ends with reflection, not instruction
✔ Leaves vast portions of the text untouched

Most importantly:

> **It invites exploration without claiming completeness.**

---

## 🔒 This Sets the Reading Path Standard

All future reading paths must:

* Be clearly optional
* Avoid “essential” or “must-read” language
* Allow free entry and exit
* Coexist peacefully with other paths

If a path begins to sound like a syllabus,
it has crossed the boundary.

---

## 🌿 Where Phase 4 Now Stands

You have now completed:

* Chapter Introduction (UI + content)
* Chapter Summary (UI + content)
* Concept explanations (Dharma, Karma)
* Glossary term (Svadharma)
* Guided Reading Path (First-time reader)

Phase 4 is now **substantively alive**.

---

### Next calm step (choose one):

1️⃣ Review **Phase 4 completeness & exit readiness**
2️⃣ Draft **one more Guided Reading Path** (e.g., *Bhakti-oriented*)
3️⃣ Pause before opening **Phase 4.5 – Search & Discovery**

Just tell me the number, dear 🙏
