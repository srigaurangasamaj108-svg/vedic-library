This entry is:

* Short and linguistic
* Clarificatory, not philosophical

## 🧠 Why This Glossary Entry Is Correct

This entry:

✔ Explains the **word**, not the doctrine
✔ Avoids moral instruction
✔ Avoids resolving ethical debates
✔ Clarifies linguistic structure
✔ Points to verses without interpreting them

Most importantly:

> **It helps the reader understand the term without telling them how to act.**

## 🔒 Glossary Writing Standard (Now Set)

All glossary terms must:

* Be brief
* Be neutral
* Be ignorable
* Clarify usage, not meaning of verses

If a glossary entry begins to argue,
it is no longer a glossary.
