Yes — and we will **decide this consciously**, not just follow a recommendation.

---

## ✅ **Decision: First Educational Artifact = Chapter 1 Introduction**

**Artifact chosen:**
👉 **Bhagavad-gītā, Chapter 1 – Chapter Introduction**

This is now **officially locked** as the **first educational implementation** of Phase 4.

---

## 🧠 Why Chapter 1 Introduction is the Correct First Artifact

This choice is not accidental. It satisfies **all Phase 4 principles** at once.

### 1️⃣ It sits *before* the text, not *inside* it

* No verse is modified
* No commentary is touched
* No interpretation is imposed
* Reader can ignore it completely

This perfectly respects **śāstra primacy**.

---

### 2️⃣ It helps *every* kind of reader

* First-time reader → gets emotional & narrative context
* Scholar → sees framing, not conclusions
* Devotee → sees Arjuna’s dilemma clearly, not moralized

No one is excluded. No one is instructed what to think.

---

### 3️⃣ It establishes the **educational tone** for the whole platform

Chapter 1 is:

* Narrative
* Emotional
* Ethical, not metaphysical yet

If education can remain **calm here**, it will remain calm everywhere.

This makes it the **acid test** for Phase 4.

---

### 4️⃣ It becomes the template for everything else

Once Chapter 1 Introduction is done correctly, you automatically get:

* Chapter 2–18 introductions (same schema)
* Chapter summaries (mirrored structure)
* Educational UI patterns
* Guide attribution patterns
* Metadata discipline

So one artifact unlocks **an entire category**.

---

## 📌 What This Artifact MUST Do (Boundaries)

The **Chapter 1 Introduction must**:

✔ Describe the setting (battlefield, families, tension)
✔ Describe Arjuna’s inner conflict
✔ Describe *why* a dialogue is about to begin

The **Chapter 1 Introduction must NOT**:

❌ Explain karma-yoga
❌ Preach bhakti
❌ Resolve Arjuna’s confusion
❌ Quote later chapters
❌ Tell the reader “what the Gītā teaches”

It must end with **openness**, not answers.

---

## 🧱 Canonical Identity (Locked)

This artifact will be:

```text
UID: edu.bg.chapter.01.intro
Type: chapter_introduction
Scope: Bhagavad-gītā, Chapter 1 only
Layer: Educational (optional)
```

It becomes the **reference standard** for all future educational content.

---

## 🪜 What Comes Immediately Next (Very Precise)

Now that the artifact is chosen, the **correct next step** is:

### 👉 **Design UI behavior for educational overlays (no code)**

Why UI next, not writing?

Because:

* UI behavior determines *whether education feels intrusive*
* Writing before UI risks overstepping
* Phase 4 discipline demands *experience-first design*

---

### 🔜 Next step options (choose one):

1️⃣ **Design UI behavior for Chapter Introductions** (recommended)
2️⃣ Draft the **actual Chapter 1 Introduction text** (only after UI is locked)
3️⃣ Define **Guide attribution & review workflow**

Just tell me the number, dear 🙏
