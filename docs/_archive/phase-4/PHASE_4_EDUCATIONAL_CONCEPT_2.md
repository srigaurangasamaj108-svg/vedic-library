    "In the Bhagavad-gītā, karma is examined especially in situations where action is unavoidable, raising questions about responsibility, attachment, and outcome."

  "usage_notes": [
    "Karma does not simply mean fate or predestination.",

## 🧠 Why This Concept Text Is Correct

This explanation:

✔ Centers on **action**, not metaphysics
✔ Avoids equating karma with reward/punishment
✔ Avoids theological claims
✔ Leaves interpretive depth to commentary
✔ Supports multiple traditions without privileging one

Most importantly:

> **It corrects common misunderstandings without replacing inquiry.**

## 🔒 Concept Writing Standard (Reinforced)

From now on, all concept explanations must:

* Start from etymology or core meaning
* Explain range of usage
* Avoid moralizing conclusions
* Point back to scripture without interpreting it

If a concept begins to answer *“what should I do?”*,
it has exceeded its role.
