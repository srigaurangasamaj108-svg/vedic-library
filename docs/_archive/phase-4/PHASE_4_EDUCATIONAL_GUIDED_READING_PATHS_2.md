Very good. Below is the **second Guided Reading Path**, designed to complement the first-time reader path without competing with it.

This **Bhakti-oriented path** is:

* Devotional in focus, not sectarian
* Text-respectful, not interpretive
* Suggestive, not directive
* Fully optional and reversible

## 🧠 Why This Bhakti Path Is Correct

This path:

✔ Centers devotion without negating action or knowledge
✔ Avoids sectarian claims
✔ Does not assert bhakti as “the only way”
✔ Includes narrative, vision, qualities, and conclusion
✔ Leaves interpretation to commentary layers

Most importantly:

> **It reflects a devotional orientation without turning devotion into instruction.**

---

## 🔒 Reading Path Balance (Important)

You now have **two complementary paths**:

* *First-time Reader* → narrative & orientation
* *Bhakti-oriented* → devotional emphasis

Neither path:

* Overrides the other
* Claims completeness
* Restricts reading

This coexistence is exactly what Phase 4 intends.

---

## 🌿 Phase 4 Status (Honest Assessment)

At this point, Phase 4 includes:

✔ Educational UI behaviors (locked)
✔ Chapter Introduction (content + UI)
✔ Chapter Summary (content + UI)
✔ Concepts (Dharma, Karma)
✔ Glossary (Svadharma)
✔ Guided Reading Paths (2 paths)

Phase 4 is now **functionally complete in spirit**.

---

### Next calm step (choose one):

1️⃣ Review **Phase 4 Exit Criteria** and declare Phase 4 COMPLETE
2️⃣ Draft **one more concept** (e.g., *Bhakti* or *Jñāna*)
3️⃣ Consciously open **Phase 4.5 – Search & Discovery**

Just tell me the number, dear 🙏
