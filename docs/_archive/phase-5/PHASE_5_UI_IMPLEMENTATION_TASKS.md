Excellent. This is exactly how Phase 5 should begin: by turning the UI/UX constitution into clear, implementable work units, without jumping into visuals or code too fast.
Below is a Phase 5 UI Implementation Task Breakdown, written like an execution plan you can keep referring to in future chats.

# 🧱 PHASE 5 — UI IMPLEMENTATION TASKS  
## Vedic Library Project  
### From Constitution → Working Interface

---

## 🎯 Phase 5 Objective (Restated Clearly)

Phase 5 is **not** about adding new features.

Phase 5 is about:
- **Unifying** everything built so far
- **Polishing the reading workspace**
- **Making the interface world-class, calm, and scholarly**

This phase focuses entirely on **frontend UI/UX implementation**.

## 🧭 PHASE 5 STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

You may now begin Phase 5 calmly, task by task.

🌿 Where to go next (your choice)
