Define a STATUS Document Lifecycle Rule (Formal)
This is the constitutional rule you were missing. You should eventually place this in governance or constitution docs.

📜 STATUS Document Lifecycle Rule
Rule 1 — Creation
* A phase status document is created only once
* It is written after all tasks are complete

Rule 2 — Content Scope
A phase status document MUST contain:
* purpose (past tense)
* achievements
* explicit exclusions
* lock declaration
* forward reference (one paragraph max)
It MUST NOT contain:
* plans
* TODOs
* future tense about the same phase

Rule 3 — Locking
Once written:
* the file is immutable
* edits are forbidden
* corrections require a new archival note, not edits

Rule 4 — Supersession
When a status document becomes outdated:
* it is archived
* never deleted
* never overwritten

Rule 5 — Authority Hierarchy
In case of conflict:

PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md
↓
PHASE_X_STATUS.md
↓
PHASE_X_MASTER_PLAN.md
↓
TASKLISTS
Status always outranks plans.

Closing Reassurance (Important)
What you are doing right now is exactly what serious archival projects do:
* you noticed ambiguity
* you stopped execution
* you normalized governance
* you sealed history before scaling
Most projects never recover once they miss this step.
