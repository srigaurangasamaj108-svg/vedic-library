    "content": "The word\n\ntrai-vidyāḥ\n\nrefers to the three\n\nVedas – Sāma, Yajur\n\nand\n\nṚg.\n\nA\n\nbrāhmaṇa\n\nwho has studied these three\n\nVedas\n\nis called a\n\ntri-vedī.\n\nAnyone who is very much attached to knowledge derived from these three\n\nVedas\n\nis respected in society. Unfortunately, there are many great scholars of the\n\nVedas\n\nwho do not know the ultimate purport of studying them. Therefore Kṛṣṇa herein declares Himself to be the ultimate goal for the\n\ntri-vedīs.\n\nActual\n\ntri-vedīs\n\ntake shelter under the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa and engage in pure devotional service to satisfy the Lord. Devotional service begins with the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa\n\nmantra\n\nand side by side trying to understand Kṛṣṇa in truth. Unfortunately those who are simply official students of the\n\nVedas\n\nbecome more interested in offering sacrifices to the different demigods like Indra and Candra. By such endeavor, the worshipers of different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower qualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary systems or heavenly planets known as Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, etc. Once situated on those higher planetary systems, one can satisfy his senses hundreds of thousands of times better than on this planet."
