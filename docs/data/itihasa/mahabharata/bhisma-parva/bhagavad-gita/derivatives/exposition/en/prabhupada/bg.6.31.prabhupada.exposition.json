    "content": "A\n\nyogī\n\nwho is practicing meditation on the Supersoul sees within himself the plenary portion of Kṛṣṇa as Viṣṇu – with four hands, holding conchshell, wheel, club and lotus flower. The\n\nyogī\n\nshould know that Viṣṇu is not different from Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa in this form of Supersoul is situated in everyone’s heart. Furthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls present in the innumerable hearts of living entities. Nor is there a difference between a Kṛṣṇa conscious person always engaged in the transcendental loving service of Kṛṣṇa and a perfect\n\nyogī\n\nengaged in meditation on the Supersoul. The\n\nyogī\n\nin Kṛṣṇa consciousness – even though he may be engaged in various activities while in material existence – remains always situated in Kṛṣṇa. This is confirmed in the\n\nBhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu\n\n(1.2.187) of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī:\n\nnikhilāsv apy avasthāsu jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate.\n\nA devotee of the Lord, always acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is automatically liberated. In the\n\nNārada Pañcarātra\n\nthis is confirmed in this way:\n\ndik-kālādy-anavacchinne\n\nkṛṣṇe ceto vidhāya ca\n\ntan-mayo bhavati kṣipraṁ\n\njīvo brahmaṇi yojayet\n\n“By concentrating one’s attention on the transcendental form of Kṛṣṇa, who is all-pervading and beyond time and space, one becomes absorbed in thinking of Kṛṣṇa and then attains the happy state of transcendental association with Him.”\n\nKṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest stage of trance in yoga practice. This very understanding that Kṛṣṇa is present as Paramātmā in everyone’s heart makes the\n\nyogī\n\nfaultless. The\n\nVedas\n\n(\n\nGopāla-tāpanī Upaniṣad\n\n1.21) confirm this inconceivable potency of the Lord as follows:\n\neko ’pi san bahudhā yo ’vabhāti.\n\n“Although the Lord is one, He is present in innumerable hearts as many.” Similarly, in the\n\nsmṛti-śāstra\n\nit is said:\n\neka eva paro viṣṇuḥ\n\nsarva-vyāpī na saṁśayaḥ\n\naiśvaryād rūpam ekaṁ ca\n\nsūrya-vat bahudheyate\n\n“Viṣṇu is one, and yet He is certainly all-pervading. By His inconceivable potency, in spite of His one form, He is present everywhere, as the sun appears in many places at once.”"
