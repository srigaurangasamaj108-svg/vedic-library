    "content": "Dyāv ā-pṛthivyoḥ\n\n(“the space between heaven and earth”) and\n\nloka-trayam\n\n(“the three worlds”) are significant words in this verse because it appears that not only did Arjuna see this universal form of the Lord, but others in other planetary systems saw it also. Arjuna’s seeing of the universal form was not a dream. All whom the Lord endowed with divine vision saw that universal form on the battlefield."
