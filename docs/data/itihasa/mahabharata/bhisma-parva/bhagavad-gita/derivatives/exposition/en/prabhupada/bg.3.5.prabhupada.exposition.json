    "content": "It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be always active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by the illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the\n\nśāstras.\n\nBut if the soul is engaged in his natural function of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him. The\n\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\n\n(1.5.17)\n\naffirms this:\n\ntyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harer\n\nbhajann apakvo ’tha patet tato yadi\n\nyatra kva vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kiṁ\n\nko vārtha āpto ’bhajatāṁ sva-dharmataḥ\n\n“If someone takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the\n\nśāstras\n\nor execute the devotional service properly, and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the\n\nśāstras,\n\nwhat does it avail him if he is not Kṛṣṇa conscious?” So the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore,\n\nsannyāsa,\n\nor any purificatory process, is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, without which everything is considered a failure."
