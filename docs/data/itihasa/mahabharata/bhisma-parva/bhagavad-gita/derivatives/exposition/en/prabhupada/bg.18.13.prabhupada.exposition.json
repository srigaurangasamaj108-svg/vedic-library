    "content": "A question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some reaction, how is it that the person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness does not suffer or enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing\n\nVedānta\n\nphilosophy to show how this is possible. He says that there are five causes for all activities, and for success in all activity one should consider these five causes.\n\nSāṅkhya\n\nmeans the stock of knowledge, and\n\nVedānta\n\nis the final stock of knowledge accepted by all leading\n\nācāryas.\n\nEven Śaṅkara accepts\n\nVedānta-sūtra\n\nas such. Therefore such authority should be consulted.\n\nThe ultimate control is invested in the Supersoul. As it is stated in the\n\nBhagavad-gītā, sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ.\n\nHe is engaging everyone in certain activities by reminding him of his past actions. And Kṛṣṇa conscious acts done under His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life or in the life after death."
