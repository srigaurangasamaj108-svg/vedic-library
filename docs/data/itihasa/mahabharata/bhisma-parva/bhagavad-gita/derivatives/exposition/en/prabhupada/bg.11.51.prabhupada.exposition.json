    "content": "Here the words\n\nmānuṣaṁ rūpam\n\nclearly indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be originally two-handed. Those who deride Kṛṣṇa as if He were an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of His divine nature. If Kṛṣṇa is like an ordinary human being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and again to show the four-handed Nārāyaṇa form? So it is very clearly stated in\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nthat one who thinks that Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary person and who misguides the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within Kṛṣṇa speaking is doing the greatest injustice. Kṛṣṇa has actually shown His universal form and His four-handed Viṣṇu form. So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nbecause he knows what is what. The original verses of\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nare as clear as the sun; they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators."
