    "content": "“Sacred place” refers to places of pilgrimage. In India the\n\nyogīs\n\n– the transcendentalists or the devotees – all leave home and reside in sacred places such as Prayāga, Mathurā, Vṛndāvana, Hṛṣīkeśa and Hardwar and in solitude practice\n\nyoga\n\nwhere the sacred rivers like the Yamunā and the Ganges flow. But often this is not possible, especially for Westerners. The so-called\n\nyoga\n\nsocieties in big cities may be successful in earning material benefit, but they are not at all suitable for the actual practice of\n\nyoga.\n\nOne who is not self-controlled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation. Therefore, in the\n\nBṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa\n\nit is said that in Kali-yuga (the present\n\nyuga,\n\nor age), when people in general are short-lived, slow in spiritual realization and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of spiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord.\n\nharer nāma harer nāma\n\nharer nāmaiva kevalam\n\nkalau nāsty eva nāsty eva\n\nnāsty eva gatir anyathā\n\n“In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.”"
