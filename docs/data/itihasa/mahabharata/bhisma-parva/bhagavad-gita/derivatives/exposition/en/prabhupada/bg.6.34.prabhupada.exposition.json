    "content": "The mind is so strong and obstinate that it sometimes overcomes the intelligence, although the mind is supposed to be subservient to the intelligence. For a man in the practical world who has to fight so many opposing elements, it is certainly very difficult to control the mind. Artificially, one may establish a mental equilibrium toward both friend and enemy, but ultimately no worldly man can do so, for this is more difficult than controlling the raging wind. In the Vedic literature (\n\nKaṭha Upaniṣad\n\n1.3.3–4) it is said:\n\nātmānaṁ rathinaṁ viddhi\n\nśarīraṁ ratham eva ca\n\nbuddhiṁ tu sārathiṁ viddhi\n\nmanaḥ pragraham eva ca\n\nindriyāṇi hayān āhur\n\nviṣayāṁs teṣu gocarān\n\nātmendriya-mano-yuktaṁ\n\nbhoktety āhur manīṣiṇaḥ\n\n“The individual is the passenger in the car of the material body, and intelligence is the driver. Mind is the driving instrument, and the senses are the horses. The self is thus the enjoyer or sufferer in the association of the mind and senses. So it is understood by great thinkers.” Intelligence is supposed to direct the mind, but the mind is so strong and obstinate that it often overcomes even one’s own intelligence, as an acute infection may surpass the efficacy of medicine. Such a strong mind is supposed to be controlled by the practice of\n\nyoga,\n\nbut such practice is never practical for a worldly person like Arjuna. And what can we say of modern man? The simile used here is appropriate: one cannot capture the blowing wind. And it is even more difficult to capture the turbulent mind. The easiest way to control the mind, as suggested by Lord Caitanya, is chanting “Hare Kṛṣṇa,” the great\n\nmantra\n\nfor deliverance, in all humility. The method prescribed is\n\nsa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ:\n\none must engage one’s mind fully in Kṛṣṇa. Only then will there remain no other engagements to agitate the mind."
