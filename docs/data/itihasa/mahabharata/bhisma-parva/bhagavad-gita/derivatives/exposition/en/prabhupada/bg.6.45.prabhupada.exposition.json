    "content": "A person born in a particularly righteous, aristocratic or sacred family becomes conscious of his favorable condition for executing\n\nyoga\n\npractice. With determination, therefore, he begins his unfinished task, and thus he completely cleanses himself of all material contaminations. When he is finally free from all contaminations, he attains the supreme perfection – Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the perfect stage of being freed of all contaminations. This is confirmed in the\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\n(7.28)\n\n:\n\nyeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ\n\njanānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām\n\nte dvandva-moha-nirmuktā\n\nbhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ\n\n“After many, many births of executing pious activities, when one is completely freed from all contaminations, and from all illusory dualities, one becomes engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.”"
