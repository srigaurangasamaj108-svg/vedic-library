    "content": "A strong faith that by Kṛṣṇa consciousness one will be elevated to the highest perfection of life is called\n\nvyavasāyātmikā\n\nintelligence. The\n\nCaitanya-caritāmṛta\n\n(\n\nMadhya\n\n22.62)\n\nstates:\n\n‘śraddhā’-śabde – viśvāsa kahe sudṛḍha niścaya\n\nkṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya\n\nFaith means unflinching trust in something sublime. When one is engaged in the duties of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations to family traditions, humanity or nationality. Fruitive activities are the engagements of one’s reactions from past good or bad deeds. When one is awake in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities. When one is situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically achieved by progressive Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\nThe resolute purpose of a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is based on knowledge.\n\nVāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ:\n\na person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the rare good soul who knows perfectly that Vāsudeva, or Kṛṣṇa, is the root of all manifested causes. As by watering the root of a tree one automatically distributes water to the leaves and branches, so by acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness one can render the highest service to everyone – namely self, family, society, country, humanity, etc. If Kṛṣṇa is satisfied by one’s actions, then everyone will be satisfied.\n\nService in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of Kṛṣṇa, who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As such, to be well versed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of Kṛṣṇa, and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one’s mission in life. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows:\n\nyasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo\n\nyasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto ’pi\n\ndhyāyan stuvaṁs tasya yaśas tri-sandhyaṁ\n\nvande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam\n\n“By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.”\n\nThe whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the body – not theoretically but practically, when there is no longer a chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities. One who is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts."
