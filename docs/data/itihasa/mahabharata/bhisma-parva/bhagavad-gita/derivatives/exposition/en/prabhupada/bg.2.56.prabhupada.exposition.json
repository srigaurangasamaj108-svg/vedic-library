    "content": "The word\n\nmuni\n\nmeans one who can agitate his mind in various ways for mental speculation without coming to a factual conclusion. It is said that every\n\nmuni\n\nhas a different angle of vision, and unless a\n\nmuni\n\ndiffers from other\n\nmunis,\n\nhe cannot be called a\n\nmuni\n\nin the strict sense of the term.\n\nNāsāv ṛṣir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam\n\n(\n\nMahābhārata, Vana-parva\n\n313.117). But a\n\nsthita-dhīr muni,\n\nas mentioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinary\n\nmuni.\n\nThe\n\nsthita-dhīr muni\n\nis always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation. He is called\n\npraśānta-niḥśeṣa-mano-rathāntara\n\n(\n\nStotra-ratna\n\n43), or one who has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, or Vāsudeva, is everything (\n\nvāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ\n\n). He is called a\n\nmuni\n\nfixed in mind. Such a fully Kṛṣṇa conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord’s grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things for one’s own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one fixed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. Success or no success, a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is always steady in his determination."
