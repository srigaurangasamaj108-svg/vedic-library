    "content": "Among the created manifestations, the first is the creation of the total material elements. As explained before, the cosmic manifestation is created and conducted by Mahā-viṣṇu, Garbhodaka-śāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodaka-śāyī Viṣṇu, and then again it is annihilated by Lord Śiva. Brahmā is a secondary creator. All these agents of creation, maintenance and annihilation are incarnations of the material qualities of the Supreme Lord. Therefore He is the beginning, the middle and the end of all creation.\n\nFor advanced education there are various kinds of books of knowledge, such as the four\n\nVedas,\n\ntheir six supplements, the\n\nVedānta-sūtra,\n\nbooks of logic, books of religiosity and the\n\nPurāṇas.\n\nSo all together there are fourteen divisions of books of education. Of these, the book which presents\n\nadhyātma-vidyā,\n\nspiritual knowledge – in particular, the\n\nVedānta-sūtra\n\n– represents Kṛṣṇa.\n\nAmong logicians there are different kinds of argument. Supporting one’s argument with evidence that also supports the opposing side is called\n\njalpa.\n\nMerely trying to defeat one’s opponent is called\n\nvitaṇḍā.\n\nBut the actual conclusion is called\n\nvāda.\n\nThis conclusive truth is a representation of Kṛṣṇa."
