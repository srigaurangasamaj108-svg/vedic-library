    "content": "There are many transcendentalists on the path of spiritual self-realization, but one who is not situated in self-realization cannot see how things are changing in the body of the living entity. The word\n\nyoginaḥ\n\nis significant in this connection. In the present day there are many so-called\n\nyogīs,\n\nand there are many so-called associations of\n\nyogīs,\n\nbut they are actually blind in the matter of self-realization. They are simply addicted to some sort of gymnastic exercise and are satisfied if the body is well built and healthy. They have no other information. They are called\n\nyatanto ’py akṛtātmānaḥ.\n\nEven though they are endeavoring in a so-called\n\nyoga\n\nsystem, they are not self-realized. Such people cannot understand the process of the transmigration of the soul. Only those who are actually in the\n\nyoga\n\nsystem and have realized the self, the world and the Supreme Lord – in other words, the\n\nbhakti-yogīs,\n\nthose engaged in pure devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness – can understand how things are taking place."
