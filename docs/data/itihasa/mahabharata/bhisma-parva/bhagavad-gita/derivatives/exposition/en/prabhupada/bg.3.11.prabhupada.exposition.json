    "content": "The demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs. The supply of air, light, water and all other benedictions for maintaining the body and soul of every living entity is entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable assistants in different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their pleasures and displeasures are dependent on the performance of\n\nyajñas\n\nby the human being. Some of the\n\nyajñas\n\nare meant to satisfy particular demigods; but even in so doing, Lord Viṣṇu is worshiped in all\n\nyajñas\n\nas the chief beneficiary. It is stated also in the\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nthat Kṛṣṇa Himself is the beneficiary of all kinds of\n\nyajñas: bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasām.\n\nTherefore, ultimate satisfaction of the\n\nyajña-pati\n\nis the chief purpose of all\n\nyajñas.\n\nWhen these\n\nyajñas\n\nare perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in charge of the different departments of supply are pleased, and there is no scarcity in the supply of natural products.\n\nPerformance of\n\nyajñas\n\nhas many side benefits, ultimately leading to liberation from material bondage. By performance of\n\nyajñas,\n\nall activities become purified, as it is stated in the\n\nVedas: āhāra-śuddhau sattva-śuddhiḥ sattva-śuddhau dhruvā smṛtiḥ smṛti-lambhe sarva-granthīnāṁ vipramokṣaḥ.\n\nBy performance of\n\nyajña\n\none’s eatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified foodstuffs one’s very existence becomes purified; by the purification of existence finer tissues in the memory become sanctified, and when memory is sanctified one can think of the path of liberation, and all these combined together lead to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the great necessity of present-day society."
