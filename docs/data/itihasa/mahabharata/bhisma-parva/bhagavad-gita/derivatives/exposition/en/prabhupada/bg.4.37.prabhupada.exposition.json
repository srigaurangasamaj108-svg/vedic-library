    "content": "Perfect knowledge of self and Superself and of their relationship is compared herein to fire. This fire not only burns up all reactions to impious activities, but also all reactions to pious activities, turning them to ashes. There are many stages of reaction: reaction in the making, reaction fructifying, reaction already achieved, and reaction\n\na priori.\n\nBut knowledge of the constitutional position of the living entity burns everything to ashes. When one is in complete knowledge, all reactions, both\n\na priori\n\nand\n\na posteriori,\n\nare consumed. In the\n\nVedas\n\n(\n\nBṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad\n\n4.4.22) it is stated,\n\nubhe uhaivaiṣa ete taraty amṛtaḥ sādhv-asādhūnī:\n\n“One overcomes both the pious and impious reactions of work.”"
