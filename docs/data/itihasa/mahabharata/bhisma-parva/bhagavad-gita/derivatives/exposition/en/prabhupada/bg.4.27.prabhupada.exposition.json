    "content": "The\n\nyoga\n\nsystem conceived by Patañjali is referred to herein. In the\n\nYoga-sūtra\n\nof Patañjali, the soul is called\n\npratyag-ātmā\n\nand\n\nparāg-ātmā.\n\nAs long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called\n\nparāg-ātmā,\n\nbut as soon as the same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is called\n\npratyag-ātmā.\n\nThe soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Patañjali system of\n\nyoga\n\ninstructs one on how to control the functions of the body’s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this\n\nyoga\n\nsystem,\n\npratyag-ātmā\n\nis the ultimate goal. This\n\npratyag-ātmā\n\nis withdrawn from activities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, and hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They are called the functions of the\n\nprāṇa-vāyu.\n\nThe\n\napāna-vāyu\n\ngoes downwards,\n\nvyāna-vāyu\n\nacts to shrink and expand,\n\nsamāna-vāyu\n\nadjusts equilibrium,\n\nudāna-vāyu\n\ngoes upwards – and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization."
