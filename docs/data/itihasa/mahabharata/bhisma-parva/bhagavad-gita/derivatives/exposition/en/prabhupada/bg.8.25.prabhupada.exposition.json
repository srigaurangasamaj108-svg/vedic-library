    "content": "In the Third Canto of\n\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\n\nKapila Muni mentions that those who are expert in fruitive activities and sacrificial methods on earth attain to the moon at death. These elevated souls live on the moon for about 10,000 years (by demigod calculations) and enjoy life by drinking\n\nsoma-rasa.\n\nThey eventually return to earth. This means that on the moon there are higher classes of living beings, though they may not be perceived by the gross senses."
