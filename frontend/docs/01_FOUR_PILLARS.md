# The Four Pillars Architecture

## 1. Library

The canonical source layer.

- Śruti
- Smṛti
- Itihāsa
- Purāṇa
- Āgama
- Vedāṅga
- Upaveda
- Darśana
- Sampradāya

This pillar is ontology-first.

## 2. Education

Transforms canonical knowledge into:

- Curriculum
- Course structures
- Skill mapping
- Age-based sequencing
- Certification logic

Education does not duplicate Library.
It references Library nodes.

## 3. Guidance

Applies knowledge to:

- Life situations
- Dharma decisions
- Social roles
- Varṇa/āśrama contexts
- Emotional states
- Conflict resolution

Guidance uses thematic and principle layers.

## 4. Community

Implements knowledge through:

- Events
- Departments
- Service roles
- Temple life
- Cultural expression
- Mentorship structures

Community integrates all pillars.
