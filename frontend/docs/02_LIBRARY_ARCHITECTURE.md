# Library Architecture

The Library is powered by a Canonical Metadata Registry.

Filesystem = storage.
Metadata Registry = intellectual structure.

Navigation must reflect epistemology, not folder structure.

Primary Domains:

- Śruti
- Smṛti
- Itihāsa
- Purāṇa
- Āgama
- Vedāṅga
- Upaveda
- Darśana
- Sampradāya

Each node supports:

- Routing
- Commentary overlays
- Curriculum eligibility
- Comparative eligibility
- Thematic tagging
- Entity linking
