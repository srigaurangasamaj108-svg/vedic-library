# Vedic Skills – Vision Document

This is not a content platform.

This is a civilizational infrastructure project.

The system is designed around four foundational pillars:

1. Library
2. Education
3. Guidance
4. Community

The Library is the canonical knowledge foundation.
Education structures knowledge into curriculum.
Guidance applies knowledge to living circumstances.
Community implements knowledge within shared life.

The architecture must:

- Be canon-agnostic
- Support multiple commentaries
- Allow comparative analysis
- Support age-based adaptation
- Enable AI-assisted translation layers
- Remain expandable for centuries

This is not software design.
This is śāstric infrastructure design.
