    "There are two classes of",
    "sannyāsīs,",
    "or persons in the renounced order of life. The Māyāvādī",
    "sannyāsīs",
    "are engaged in the study of Sāṅkhya philosophy, whereas the Vaiṣṇava",
    "sannyāsīs",
    "are engaged in the study of",
    "Bhāgavatam",
    "philosophy, which affords the proper commentary on the",

    "The Māyāvādī",
    "sannyāsīs",

    "Vedānta-sūtras,",

    "Śārīraka-bhāṣya,",

    "Bhāgavata",
    "school are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, according to",
    "pāñcarātrikī",
    "regulations, and therefore the Vaiṣṇava",
    "sannyāsīs",
    "have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Vaiṣṇava",
    "sannyāsīs",
    "have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the Māyāvādī",
    "sannyāsīs,",
    "engaged in the studies of Sāṅkhya and Vedānta and speculation, cannot relish the transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the",
    "Bhāgavatam",
    "without proper understanding. Consequently their study of the",
    "Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam",
    "becomes troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the Māyāvādī",
    "sannyāsīs.",
    "The Vaiṣṇava",
    "sannyāsīs,",
    "who are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God. The Māyāvādī",
    "sannyāsīs",
    "sometimes fall down from the path of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in Kṛṣṇa conscious activities are better situated than the",
    "sannyāsīs",
    "engaged in simple speculation about what is Brahman and what is not Brahman, although they too come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, after many births."
