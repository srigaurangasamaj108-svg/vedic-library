    "content": "Advanced\n\nyogīs\n\nare not very much attracted to the rituals of the scriptures, but they automatically become attracted to the\n\nyoga\n\nprinciples, which can elevate them to complete Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the highest\n\nyoga\n\nperfection. In the\n\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\n\n(3.33.7)\n\n, such disregard of Vedic rituals by the advanced transcendentalists is explained as follows:\n\naho bata śva-paco ’to garīyān\n\nyaj-jihvāgre vartate nāma tubhyam\n\ntepus tapas te juhuvuḥ sasnur āryā\n\nbrahmānūcur nāma gṛṇanti ye te\n\n“O my Lord! Persons who chant the holy names of Your Lordship are far, far advanced in spiritual life, even if born in families of dog-eaters. Such chanters have undoubtedly performed all kinds of austerities and sacrifices, bathed in all sacred places and finished all scriptural studies.”\n\nThe famous example of this was presented by Lord Caitanya, who accepted Ṭhākura Haridāsa as one of His most important disciples. Although Ṭhākura Haridāsa happened to take his birth in a Muslim family, he was elevated to the post of\n\nnāmācārya\n\nby Lord Caitanya due to his rigidly attended principle of chanting three hundred thousand holy names of the Lord daily: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. And because he chanted the holy name of the Lord constantly, it is understood that in his previous life he must have passed through all the ritualistic methods of the\n\nVedas,\n\nknown as\n\nśabda-brahma.\n\nUnless, therefore, one is purified, one cannot take to the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness or become engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord, Hare Kṛṣṇa."
