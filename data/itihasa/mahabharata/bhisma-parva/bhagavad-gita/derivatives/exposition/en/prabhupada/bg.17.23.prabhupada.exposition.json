    "content": "It has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme –\n\noṁ tat sat,\n\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal – they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words,\n\noṁ tat sat,\n\nparticularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word\n\noṁ\n\nis always found.\n\nOne who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charity, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the mode of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words\n\noṁ tat sat\n\nare uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g.,\n\noṁ tad viṣṇoḥ.\n\nWhenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered,\n\noṁ\n\nis added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns.\n\nOṁ ity etad brahmaṇo nediṣṭhaṁ nāma\n\nindicates the first goal. Then\n\ntat tvam asi\n\n(\n\nChāndogya Upaniṣad\n\n6.8.7) indicates the second goal. And\n\nsad eva saumya\n\n(\n\nChāndogya Upaniṣad\n\n6.2.1) indicates the third goal. Combined they become\n\noṁ tat sat.\n\nFormerly when Brahmā, the first created living entity, performed sacrifices, he indicated by these three words the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the same principle has always been followed by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great significance.\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nrecommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for\n\noṁ tat sat,\n\nor for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way."
