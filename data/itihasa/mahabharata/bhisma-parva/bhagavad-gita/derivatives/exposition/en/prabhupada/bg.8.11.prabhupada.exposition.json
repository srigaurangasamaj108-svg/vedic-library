    "content": "Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa has recommended to Arjuna the practice of\n\nṣaṭ-cakra-yoga,\n\nin which one places the air of life between the eyebrows. Taking it for granted that Arjuna might not know how to practice\n\nṣaṭ-cakra-yoga,\n\nthe Lord explains the process in the following verses. The Lord says that Brahman, although one without a second, has various manifestations and features. Especially for the impersonalists, the\n\nakṣara,\n\nor\n\noṁ-kāra\n\n– the syllable\n\noṁ\n\n– is identical with Brahman. Kṛṣṇa here explains the impersonal Brahman, into which the renounced order of sages enter.\n\nIn the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are taught to vibrate\n\noṁ\n\nand learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the spiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of Brahman’s features. This practice is very essential for the student’s advancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such\n\nbrahmacārī\n\n(unmarried celibate) life is not at all possible. The social construction of the world has changed so much that there is no possibility of one’s practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life. Throughout the world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in the\n\nbrahmacārī\n\nprinciples. Unless one practices celibacy, advancement in spiritual life is very difficult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has announced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this Age of Kali, that in this age no process of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy names of Lord Kṛṣṇa: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare."
