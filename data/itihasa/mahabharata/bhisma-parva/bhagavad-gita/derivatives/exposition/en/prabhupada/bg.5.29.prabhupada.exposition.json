    "content": "The conditioned souls within the clutches of the illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the\n\nBhagavad-gītā.\n\nThe greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord Kṛṣṇa is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā. In the\n\nVedas\n\n(\n\nŚvetāśvatara Upaniṣad\n\n6.7) the Supreme Lord is described as\n\ntam īśvarāṇāṁ paramaṁ maheśvaraṁ.\n\nUnder the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness: Lord Kṛṣṇa is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\nThis Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, generally known as\n\nkarma-yoga.\n\nThe question of mental speculation as to how\n\nkarma-yoga\n\ncan give liberation is answered herewith. To work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct Kṛṣṇa consciousness is\n\nbhakti-yoga,\n\nand\n\njñāna-yoga\n\nis a path leading to\n\nbhakti-yoga.\n\nKṛṣṇa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one’s relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with\n\nmāyā\n\n(illusion) due to the desire to lord it over\n\nmāyā,\n\nand that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one’s practical performance of duties in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And one who stands fast in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, controlling the abovementioned passions, remains factually in the transcendental stage, or\n\nbrahma-nirvāṇa.\n\nThe eightfold\n\nyoga\n\nmysticism is automatically practiced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of\n\nyama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā, dhyāna\n\nand\n\nsamādhi.\n\nBut these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the\n\nŚrīmad Bhagavad-gītā\n\nin the matter of\n\nKarma-yoga,\n\nor Action in Kṛṣṇa Consciousness."
