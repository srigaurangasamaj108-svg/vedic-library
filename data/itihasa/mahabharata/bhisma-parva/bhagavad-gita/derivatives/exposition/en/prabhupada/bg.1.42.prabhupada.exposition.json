    "content": "Community projects for the four orders of human society, combined with family welfare activities, as they are set forth by the institution of\n\nsanātana-dharma,\n\nor\n\nvarṇāśrama-dharma,\n\nare designed to enable the human being to attain his ultimate salvation. Therefore, the breaking of the\n\nsanātana-dharma\n\ntradition by irresponsible leaders of society brings about chaos in that society, and consequently people forget the aim of life – Viṣṇu. Such leaders are called blind, and persons who follow such leaders are sure to be led into chaos."
