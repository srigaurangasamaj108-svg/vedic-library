    "content": "That the highest conception of\n\nyoga\n\nperfection is Kṛṣṇa consciousness is clearly explained in this verse. And unless one is Kṛṣṇa conscious it is not at all possible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage Durvāsā Muni picked a quarrel with Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, and Durvāsā Muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses. On the other hand, the king, although not as powerful a\n\nyogī\n\nas the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage’s injustices and thereby emerged victorious. The king was able to control his senses because of the following qualifications, as mentioned in the\n\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\n\n(9.4.18–20)\n\n:\n\nsa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor\n\nvacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane\n\nkarau harer mandira-mārjanādiṣu\n\nśrutiṁ cakārācyuta-sat-kathodaye\n\nmukunda-liṅgālaya-darśane dṛśau\n\ntad-bhṛtya-gātra-sparśe ’ṅga-saṅgamam\n\nghrāṇaṁ ca tat-pāda-saroja-saurabhe\n\nśrīmat-tulasyā rasanāṁ tad-arpite\n\npādau hareḥ kṣetra-padānusarpaṇe\n\nśiro hṛṣīkeśa-padābhivandane\n\nkāmaṁ ca dāsye na tu kāma-kāmyayā\n\nyathottama-śloka-janāśrayā ratiḥ\n\n“King Ambarīṣa fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, engaged his words in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the form of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in smelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, his tongue in tasting the\n\ntulasī\n\nleaves offered to Him, his legs in traveling to the holy place where His temple is situated, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the Lord … and all these qualifications made him fit to become a\n\nmat-para\n\ndevotee of the Lord.”\n\nThe word\n\nmat-para\n\nis most significant in this connection. How one can become\n\nmat-para\n\nis described in the life of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, a great scholar and\n\nācārya\n\nin the line of the\n\nmat-para,\n\nremarks,\n\nmad-bhakti-prabhāvena sarvendriya-vijaya-pūrvikā svātma-dṛṣṭiḥ su-labheti bhāvaḥ.\n\n“The senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa.” Also, the example of fire is sometimes given: “As a blazing fire burns everything within a room, Lord Viṣṇu, situated in the heart of the\n\nyogī,\n\nburns up all kinds of impurities.” The\n\nYoga-sūtra\n\nalso prescribes meditation on Viṣṇu, and not meditation on the void. The so-called\n\nyogīs\n\nwho meditate on something other than the Viṣṇu form simply waste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria. We have to be Kṛṣṇa conscious – devoted to the Personality of Godhead. This is the aim of the real\n\nyoga."
