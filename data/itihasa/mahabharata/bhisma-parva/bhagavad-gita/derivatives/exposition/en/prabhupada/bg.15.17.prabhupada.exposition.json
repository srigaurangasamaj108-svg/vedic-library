    "content": "The idea of this verse is very nicely expressed in the\n\nKaṭha Upaniṣad\n\n(2.2.13) and\n\nŚvetāśvatara Upaniṣad\n\n(6.13). It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities, some of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated, there is the Supreme Personality, who is Paramātmā. The Upaniṣadic verse runs as follows:\n\nnityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām.\n\nThe purport is that amongst all the living entities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and gives them all the facility of enjoyment according to different work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone’s heart as Paramātmā. A wise man who can understand Him is eligible to attain perfect peace, not others."
