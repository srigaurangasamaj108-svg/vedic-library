    "content": "The Lord was acting as the spiritual master of Arjuna. Therefore it was His duty to inquire from Arjuna whether he understood the whole\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nin its proper perspective. If not, the Lord was ready to re-explain any point, or the whole\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nif so required. Actually, anyone who hears\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nfrom a bona fide spiritual master like Kṛṣṇa or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled.\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nis not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer; it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Any person fortunate enough to hear these teachings from Kṛṣṇa or from His bona fide spiritual representative is sure to become a liberated person and get out of the darkness of ignorance."
