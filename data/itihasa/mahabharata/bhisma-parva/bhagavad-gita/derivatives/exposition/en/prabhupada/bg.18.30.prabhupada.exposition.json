    "content": "Performing actions in terms of the directions of the scriptures is called\n\npravṛtti,\n\nor executing actions that deserve to be performed. And actions which are not so directed are not to be performed. One who does not know the scriptural directions becomes entangled in the actions and reactions of work. Understanding which discriminates by intelligence is situated in the mode of goodness."
