    "content": "It is here clearly stated that the supreme destination, from which there is no return, is the abode of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Person. The\n\nBrahma-saṁhitā\n\ndescribes this supreme abode as\n\nānanda-cinmaya-rasa,\n\na place where everything is full of spiritual bliss. All the variegatedness manifest there is of the quality of spiritual bliss – nothing there is material. That variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere – both in the material and in the spiritual universes.\n\nYasyāntaḥ-sthāni\n\nmeans that everything is sustained within Him, within either His spiritual or material energy. The Lord is all-pervading by these two energies.\n\nTo enter Kṛṣṇa’s supreme abode or the innumerable Vaikuṇṭha planets is possible only by\n\nbhakti,\n\ndevotional service, as clearly indicated here by the word\n\nbhaktyā.\n\nNo other process can help one attain that supreme abode. The\n\nVedas\n\n(\n\nGopāla-tāpanī Upaniṣad\n\n1.21) also describe the supreme abode and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nEko vaśī sarva-gaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ.\n\nIn that abode there is only one Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose name is Kṛṣṇa. He is the supreme merciful Deity, and although situated there as one He has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. The\n\nVedas\n\ncompare the Lord to a tree standing still yet bearing many varieties of fruits, flowers and changing leaves. The plenary expansions of the Lord who preside over the Vaikuṇṭha planets are four-armed, and they are known by a variety of names – Puruṣottama, Trivikrama, Keśava, Mādhava, Aniruddha, Hṛṣīkeśa, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Śrīdhara, Vāsudeva, Dāmodara, Janārdana, Nārāyaṇa, Vāmana, Padmanābha, etc.\n\nThe\n\nBrahma-saṁhitā\n\n(5.37)\n\nalso confirms that although the Lord is always in the supreme abode, Goloka Vṛndāvana, He is all-pervading, so that everything is going on nicely (\n\ngoloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ\n\n). As stated in the\n\nVedas\n\n(\n\nŚvetāśvatara Upaniṣad\n\n6.8),\n\nparāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate/ svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca:\n\nHis energies are so expansive that they systematically conduct everything in the cosmic manifestation without a flaw, although the Supreme Lord is far, far away."
