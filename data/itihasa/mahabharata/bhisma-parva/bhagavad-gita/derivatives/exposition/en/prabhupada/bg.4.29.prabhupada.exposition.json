    "content": "This system of\n\nyoga\n\nfor controlling the breathing process is called\n\nprāṇāyāma,\n\nand in the beginning it is practiced in the\n\nhaṭha-yoga\n\nsystem through different sitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves controlling the airs within the body so as to reverse the directions of their passage. The\n\napāna\n\nair goes downward, and the\n\nprāṇa\n\nair goes up. The\n\nprāṇāyāma-yogī\n\npractices breathing the opposite way until the currents are neutralized into\n\npūraka,\n\nequilibrium. Offering the exhaled breath into the inhaled breath is called\n\nrecaka.\n\nWhen both air currents are completely stopped, one is said to be in\n\nkumbhaka-yoga.\n\nBy practice of\n\nkumbhaka-yoga,\n\none can increase the duration of life for perfection in spiritual realization. The intelligent\n\nyogī\n\nis interested in attaining perfection in one life, without waiting for the next. For by practicing\n\nkumbhaka-yoga,\n\nthe\n\nyogīs\n\nincrease the duration of life by many, many years. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord Kṛṣṇa; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation, as stated in\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\n(14.26)\n\n:\n\nmāṁ ca yo ’vyabhicāreṇa\n\nbhakti-yogena sevate\n\nsa guṇān samatītyaitān\n\nbrahma-bhūyāya kalpate\n\n“One who engages in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord transcends the modes of material nature and is immediately elevated to the spiritual platform.” A Kṛṣṇa conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in that consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only\n\nkṛṣṇa-prasādam,\n\nor food which is offered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of getting out of the material entanglement."
