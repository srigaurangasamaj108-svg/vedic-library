    "content": "Real renunciation means that one should always think himself part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore think that he has no right to enjoy the results of his work. Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The person acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is really a\n\nsannyāsī,\n\none in the renounced order of life. By such a mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the Lord. A\n\nsannyāsī\n\nis supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities, but a person who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. This state of mind is called\n\nyogārūḍha,\n\nor the perfectional stage of\n\nyoga.\n\nAs confirmed in the Third Chapter,\n\nyas tv ātma-ratir eva syāt:\n\none who is satisfied in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his activity."
