    "content": "The entire cosmic manifestations, moving and nonmoving, are manifested by different activities of Kṛṣṇa’s energy. In the material existence we create different relationships with different living entities who are nothing but Kṛṣṇa’s marginal energy; under the creation of\n\nprakṛti\n\nsome of them appear as our father, mother, grandfather, creator, etc., but actually they are parts and parcels of Kṛṣṇa. As such, these living entities who appear to be our father, mother, etc., are nothing but Kṛṣṇa. In this verse the word\n\ndhātā\n\nmeans “creator.” Not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of Kṛṣṇa, but the creator, grandmother and grandfather, etc., are also Kṛṣṇa. Actually any living entity, being part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, is Kṛṣṇa. All the\n\nVedas,\n\ntherefore, aim only toward Kṛṣṇa. Whatever we want to know through the\n\nVedas\n\nis but a progressive step toward understanding Kṛṣṇa. That subject matter which helps us purify our constitutional position is especially Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, the living entity who is inquisitive to understand all Vedic principles is also part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa and as such is also Kṛṣṇa. In all the Vedic\n\nmantras\n\nthe word\n\noṁ,\n\ncalled\n\npraṇava,\n\nis a transcendental sound vibration and is also Kṛṣṇa. And because in all the hymns of the four\n\nVedas – Sāma, Yajur, Ṛg\n\nand\n\nAtharva\n\n– the\n\npraṇava,\n\nor\n\noṁ-kāra,\n\nis very prominent, it is understood to be Kṛṣṇa."
