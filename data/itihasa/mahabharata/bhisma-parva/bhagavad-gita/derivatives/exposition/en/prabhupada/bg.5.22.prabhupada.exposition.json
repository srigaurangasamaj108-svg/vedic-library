    "content": "Material sense pleasures are due to the contact of the material senses, which are all temporary because the body itself is temporary. A liberated soul is not interested in anything which is temporary. Knowing well the joys of transcendental pleasures, how can a liberated soul agree to enjoy false pleasure? In the\n\nPadma Purāṇa\n\nit is said:\n\nramante yogino ’nante\n\nsatyānande cid-ātmani\n\niti rāma-padenāsau\n\nparaṁ brahmābhidhīyate\n\n“The mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the Absolute Truth, and therefore the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is also known as Rāma.”\n\nIn the\n\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\n\nalso (5.5.1) it is said:\n\nnāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛ-loke\n\nkaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye\n\ntapo divyaṁ putrakā yena sattvaṁ\n\nśuddhyed yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam\n\n“My dear sons, there is no reason to labor very hard for sense pleasure while in this human form of life; such pleasures are available to the stool-eaters [hogs]. Rather, you should undergo penances in this life by which your existence will be purified, and as a result you will be able to enjoy unlimited transcendental bliss.”\n\nTherefore, those who are true\n\nyogīs\n\nor learned transcendentalists are not attracted by sense pleasures, which are the causes of continuous material existence. The more one is addicted to material pleasures, the more he is entrapped by material miseries."
