    "content": "The unsuccessful\n\nyogīs\n\nare divided into two classes: one is fallen after very little progress, and one is fallen after long practice of\n\nyoga.\n\nThe\n\nyogī\n\nwho falls after a short period of practice goes to the higher planets, where pious living entities are allowed to enter. After prolonged life there, one is sent back again to this planet, to take birth in the family of a righteous\n\nbrāhmaṇa\n\nVaiṣṇava or of aristocratic merchants.\n\nThe real purpose of\n\nyoga\n\npractice is to achieve the highest perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as explained in the last verse of this chapter. But those who do not persevere to such an extent and who fail because of material allurements are allowed, by the grace of the Lord, to make full utilization of their material propensities. And after that, they are given opportunities to live prosperous lives in righteous or aristocratic families. Those who are born in such families may take advantage of the facilities and try to elevate themselves to full Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
