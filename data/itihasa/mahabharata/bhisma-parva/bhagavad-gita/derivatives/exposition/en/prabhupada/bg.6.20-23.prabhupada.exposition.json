    "content": "By practice of\n\nyoga\n\none becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This is the primary characteristic of the\n\nyoga\n\nprinciple. And after this, one becomes situated in trance, or\n\nsamādhi,\n\nwhich means that the\n\nyogī\n\nrealizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself.\n\nYoga\n\npractice is more or less based on the principles of the Patañjali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Patañjali system of\n\nyoga.\n\nThere is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Patañjali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure, out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure – realized through transcendental senses – is accepted. And this is corroborated by Patañjali Muni, the famous exponent of the\n\nyoga\n\nsystem. The great sage declares in his\n\nYoga-sūtras\n\n(4.33):\n\npuruṣārtha-śūnyānāṁ guṇānāṁ pratiprasavaḥ kaivalyaṁ svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti.\n\nThis\n\nciti-śakti,\n\nor internal potency, is transcendental.\n\nPuruṣārtha\n\nmeans material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This “oneness with the Supreme” is called\n\nkaivalyam\n\nby the monist. But according to Patañjali, this\n\nkaivalyam\n\nis an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called\n\nceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam,\n\nor clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This “clearance” is actually liberation, or\n\nbhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam.\n\nThe theory of\n\nnirvāṇa\n\n– also preliminary – corresponds with this principle. In the\n\nBhāgavatam\n\n(2.10.6)\n\nthis is called\n\nsvarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ.\n\nThe\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nalso confirms this situation in this verse.\n\nAfter\n\nnirvāṇa,\n\nor material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service to the Lord, known as Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the words of the\n\nBhāgavatam, svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ:\n\nthis is the “real life of the living entity.”\n\nMāyā,\n\nor illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Patañjali also accepts this by his words\n\nkaivalyaṁ svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti.\n\nThis\n\nciti-śakti,\n\nor transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the\n\nVedānta-sūtra\n\n(1.1.12) as\n\nānanda-mayo ’bhyāsāt.\n\nThis natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of\n\nyoga\n\nand is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or\n\nbhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga\n\nwill be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of\n\nBhagavad-gītā.\n\nIn the\n\nyoga\n\nsystem, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of\n\nsamādhi,\n\ncalled\n\nsamprajñāta-samādhi\n\nand\n\nasamprajñāta-samādhi.\n\nWhen one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, he is said to have achieved\n\nsamprajñāta-samādhi.\n\nIn the\n\nasamprajñāta-samādhi\n\nthere is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the\n\nyogī\n\nis once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the\n\nyogī\n\nis able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today’s so-called\n\nyoga\n\npractice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A\n\nyogī\n\nindulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those\n\nyogīs\n\nwho are attracted by the\n\nsiddhis\n\n(perfections) in the process of\n\nyoga\n\nare not perfectly situated. If\n\nyogīs\n\nare attracted by the by-products of\n\nyoga,\n\nthen they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or\n\nsiddhis\n\nshould know that the aim of\n\nyoga\n\nis lost in that way.\n\nThe best practice of\n\nyoga\n\nin this age is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is not baffling. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing\n\nhaṭha-yoga, dhyāna-yoga\n\nand\n\njñāna-yoga,\n\nbut there is no such problem in executing\n\nkarma-yoga\n\nor\n\nbhakti-yoga.\n\nAs long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure\n\nbhakti-yoga,\n\nor in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences – such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative – but he is always alert to execute his duties in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or\n\nbhakti-yoga.\n\nAccidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\n(2.14)\n\n,\n\nāgamāpāyino ’nityās tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata.\n\nHe endures all such incidental occurrences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in\n\nyoga\n\npractice."
