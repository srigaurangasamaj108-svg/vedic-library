## HERO SECTION

Title:
Pillar II — Structured Education Framework

Subtitle:
From Canon to Curriculum

Intro Paragraph:

Canonical text preserves knowledge.

Education organizes it for transmission.

This pillar describes how structured learning
emerges from stable canonical identity —
without altering it.

---

## SECTION 1 — FROM VERSE TO LEARNING UNIT

Heading:
From Canonical Unit to Curriculum Element

Content:

Each canonical unit may generate:

• Concept nodes  
• Principle statements  
• Thematic clusters  
• Skill classifications  
• Cross-śāstra references  

Education does not rewrite text.
It organizes meaning around it.

---

## VISUAL PLACEHOLDER — LEARNING FLOW DIAGRAM

Insert structured flow diagram:

Verse → Principle → Theme → Module → Course

Caption:
Learning builds outward from identity.

---

## SECTION 2 — MULTI-LEVEL LEARNING PATHS

Heading:
Layered Learning Pathways

Content:

The framework allows:

Introductory pathways  
Intermediate thematic tracks  
Advanced comparative studies  
Research-level cross-referencing  

All pathways resolve back to canonical reference.

No detached abstraction.

---

## SECTION 3 — TAXONOMY & SKILL MAPPING

Heading:
Structured Taxonomy & Skill Integration

Content:

The system supports mapping across domains:

Ethics  
Leadership  
Psychology  
Governance  
Education  
Social Order  
Personal Discipline  
Metaphysics  

Taxonomy does not replace scripture.
It maps applicability.

---

## SECTION 4 — CURRICULUM SAFETY

Heading:
Preserving Canon Within Education

Content:

The framework ensures:

• Canonical text remains unchanged  
• Interpretations remain attributed  
• Learning modules remain detachable  
• Courses do not become doctrinal authorities  

Education remains layered —
never canonical.

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Centered block:

Education organizes knowledge.
Structure protects it.
