# LOVEABLE PROMPT — RESEARCH & DIGITAL HUMANITIES CONTEXT
Indian Knowledge Library — Architecture Section

Design a structured academic page titled:

"Research & Digital Humanities Context"

Maintain established visual language:
• Ivory background
• Serif headings
• Indigo accents
• Muted gold highlights
• Calm spacing
• No promotional tone
• No institutional lobbying language

This page positions the project within academic discourse.

## HERO SECTION

Title:
Research & Digital Humanities Context

Subtitle:
Toward Structured Infrastructure for Indian Knowledge Systems

Intro Paragraph:

Digital humanities has transformed how texts are indexed, analyzed, and disseminated.

Yet classical śāstric traditions present structural challenges
that generic digital frameworks do not address.

The Indian Knowledge Library approaches digital preservation
as a structural research problem —
not merely a digitization effort.

## SECTION 1 — DIGITAL HUMANITIES & STRUCTURAL TEXTS

Heading:
Beyond Digitization

Content:

Most digital humanities projects focus on:

• Manuscript digitization  
• Text encoding  
• Corpus indexing  
• Searchability  
• Annotation systems  

Śāstric traditions require additional discipline:

• Canonical identity stability  
• Spine declaration  
• Layer separation  
• Cross-interpretive containment  
• Long-term UID resolution  

Digital representation must preserve structural ontology.

## VISUAL PLACEHOLDER — STRUCTURE VS DIGITIZATION

Insert minimal comparison diagram titled:

"Digitization vs Structural Infrastructure"

Caption:
Access is not structure.

## SECTION 2 — INDIAN KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS CONTEXT

Heading:
Alignment with Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS)

Content:

Indian Knowledge Systems initiatives emphasize:

• Curriculum integration  
• Interdisciplinary study  
• Civilizational awareness  
• Research-driven revitalization  

A stable digital canonical infrastructure enables:

• Reliable citation  
• Cross-text curriculum design  
• Thematic research mapping  
• Inter-traditional comparison  
• Institutional adoption  

Infrastructure precedes integration.

---

## SECTION 3 — RESEARCH APPLICATIONS

Heading:
Research Possibilities

Content:

A structured canonical system enables:

• Cross-commentary comparison  
• Philosophical lineage tracing  
• Structural motif analysis  
• Entity mapping  
• Thematic clustering  
• Version-aware textual comparison  

Scholarly disagreement remains possible —
without structural ambiguity.

---

## SECTION 4 — INSTITUTIONAL COLLABORATION

Heading:
Open to Academic Collaboration

Content:

The project is designed to:

• Support institutional partnerships  
• Enable research contributions  
• Facilitate schema refinement  
• Integrate with curriculum frameworks  
• Allow multi-disciplinary exploration  

Architecture supports plurality —
without sacrificing canonical stability.

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Centered block:

Research requires reference.
Reference requires structure.
