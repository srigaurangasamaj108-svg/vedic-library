# LOVEABLE PROMPT — AI GOVERNANCE & SAFEGUARDS
Indian Knowledge Library — Architecture Section

Design a structured academic page titled:

"AI Governance & Safeguards"

Maintain established visual language:
• Ivory background
• Serif headings
• Indigo accents
• Muted gold highlights
• Calm spacing
• No hype language
• No tech-marketing tone

This page must demonstrate disciplined AI containment.

## HERO SECTION

Title:
AI Governance & Safeguards

Subtitle:
AI as Instrument — Never as Authority

Intro Paragraph:

Artificial Intelligence is a powerful tool.

In textual traditions rooted in canonical preservation,
power must be governed by discipline.

The Indian Knowledge Library defines strict architectural boundaries for AI use.

---

## SECTION 1 — WHERE AI IS PERMITTED

Heading:
Permitted Domains of AI Assistance

Content:

AI may assist in:

• Translation drafting  
• Gloss generation  
• Semantic extraction  
• Indexing support  
• Pattern detection  
• Educational content drafting  
• Community facilitation  

AI operates in:

Semantic layer  
Interpretive layer (drafting only)  
Pedagogical layer  
Community layer  

Never in canonical layer.

---

## SECTION 2 — ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

Heading:
Non-Negotiable Boundaries

Content:

AI may never:

• Generate canonical text  
• Modify canonical text  
• Assign or redefine UID  
• Infer missing canonical structure  
• Alter declared spine  
• Resolve doctrinal disputes  
• Override human editorial authority  

Canonical layer remains AI-independent.

Forever.

## VISUAL PLACEHOLDER — LAYER PERMISSION DIAGRAM

Insert visual block titled:

"AI Permission Zones"

(Highlight allowed layers in soft color.
Canonical layer locked with shield icon or subtle lock symbol.)

Caption:
AI assists above structure.
Never defines structure.

---

## SECTION 3 — WHY RESTRAINT MATTERS

Heading:
Power Requires Containment

Content:

Large language models generate fluency —
not authority.

Without structural containment:

• Canonical drift becomes possible  
• Translation distortion scales rapidly  
• Interpretive bias compounds  
• Structural identity weakens  

Discipline ensures:

• Auditability  
• Attribution clarity  
• Reversibility  
• Human oversight  

AI becomes servant —
never master.

---

## SECTION 4 — HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP PRINCIPLE

Heading:
Review, Attribution, Traceability

Content:

All AI-assisted outputs must be:

• Clearly declared  
• Human-reviewed  
• Attributed  
• Auditable  

This protects:

• Scholarly trust  
• Institutional adoption  
• Long-term legitimacy  

Architecture governs power.

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Centered block:

Technology evolves.
Discipline must remain.
