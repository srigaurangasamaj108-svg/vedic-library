# LOVEABLE PROMPT — TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
Indian Knowledge Library — Architecture Section

Design a structured academic page titled:

"Technical Architecture Overview"

Maintain established visual language:
• Ivory background
• Serif headings
• Indigo accents
• Muted gold highlights
• Calm spacing
• No marketing language
• No startup tone

This page bridges philosophy and system implementation.

## HERO SECTION

Title:
Technical Architecture Overview

Subtitle:
From Canonical Discipline to Enforceable Infrastructure

Intro Paragraph:

Philosophy defines intent.
Architecture enforces discipline.

The Indian Knowledge Library is built as a layered system —
ensuring canonical integrity is not merely declared,
but technically enforced.

---

## SECTION 1 — SYSTEM LAYERING

Heading:
System Layer Separation

Content:

The system is organized into distinct layers:

• Canonical Data Layer  
• Semantic & Interpretive Data Layer  
• Application & Presentation Layer  
• Governance & Validation Layer  

Each layer operates independently —
yet depends downward on structural contracts.

This prevents cross-layer contamination.

---

## VISUAL PLACEHOLDER — SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE STACK

Insert large centered diagram titled:

"System Architecture Layers"

Caption:
Separation enables stability.

---

## SECTION 2 — CANONICAL DATA ENFORCEMENT

Heading:
Canonical Data Discipline

Content:

Canonical units are:

• UID-bound  
• Spine-resolved  
• Schema-validated  
• Immutable once locked  

Normalization pipelines ensure:

• Structural consistency  
• Marker enforcement  
• Language alignment  
• Version tracking  

Canonical text is not edited —
it is superseded when required.

---

## SECTION 3 — UID SYSTEM

Heading:
Stable Addressing Through UID

Content:

Each canonical unit receives a Universal Identifier.

Example:
bg.2.13  
manu.sm.2.6  

UID encodes:

• Location  
• Structural hierarchy  
• Spine alignment  

UID never encodes:

• Meaning  
• Interpretation  
• Edition  

Address stability enables:

• Cross-text mapping  
• Commentary layering  
• Long-term reference integrity  

---

## SECTION 4 — VALIDATION & GOVERNANCE

Heading:
Validation as Architectural Guardrail

Content:

System validators enforce:

• Schema conformity  
• Spine alignment  
• UID integrity  
• Layer separation  
• AI boundary compliance  

Architecture replaces trust in individuals
with enforceable structural discipline.

---

## SECTION 5 — FUTURE EXTENSIBILITY

Heading:
Designed for Scale

Content:

The system is designed to support:

• Multiple śāstra types  
• Multiple canonical unit structures  
• Multiple languages  
• Multiple traditions  
• Educational overlays  
• Institutional integration  

Expansion never alters foundation.

Foundation governs expansion.

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Centered block:

Infrastructure is discipline made executable.
