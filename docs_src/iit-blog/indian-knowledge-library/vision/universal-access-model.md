# HERO SECTION

Title:
From Canon to Citizen

Subtitle:
A Structured Access Model for Every Individual, Institution, and Community

Opening Narrative (5–7 lines):

Indian Knowledge Library is not designed merely for textual preservation.  
It is built to serve researchers, students, professionals, families, leaders, and communities across life stages and responsibilities.

The system is engineered so that the same canonical verse can support:
• Academic research
• Structured education
• Context-sensitive guidance
• Community-level application

Access is layered. Identity remains stable. Usability adapts.


---------------------------------------
# SECTION 1 — The Core Principle

Headline:
Stable Canon. Adaptive Access.

Short Explanation:

The canonical layer remains structurally unchanged.
All usability, personalization, and contextualization occur above identity — never within it.

This ensures:
• Textual integrity
• Interpretive plurality without distortion
• Role-sensitive delivery
• Long-term institutional reliability


Add visual placeholder:

[ROLE_BASED_ACCESS_DIAGRAM]

# SECTION 4 — Search Architecture Philosophy

Headline:
Search as Structured Discovery — Not Keyword Chaos

Short explanation:

Search operates across layered indexing:
• Canonical identifiers
• Semantic tags
• Thematic mapping
• Role filters
• Life-stage filters
• Seva domain classification

This enables:
• Precision for scholars
• Simplicity for laypersons
• Relevance without distortion


---------------------------------------
# SECTION 5 — From Knowledge to Living Civilization

Headline:
Structured Knowledge Becomes Social Intelligence

Explain:

When canonical stability meets:
• Educational scaffolding
• Guidance mapping
• Role-based access
• Community application

Knowledge transitions from archive to living civilization.


Closing Line (centered, serif, slightly larger):

A verse remains the same.  
Its access becomes intelligent.
