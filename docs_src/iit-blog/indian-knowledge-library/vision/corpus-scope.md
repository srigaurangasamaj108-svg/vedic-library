# LOVEABLE PROMPT — MAP OF ŚĀSTRAS  
Indian Knowledge Library

Design a structured research page titled:

Map of the Śāstric Corpus

Tone:
Academic.
Cartographic.
Precise.
Structured.
No devotional language.
No poetic exaggeration.

Visual Aesthetic:
Ivory base.
Deep indigo headings.
Muted saffron accents.
Thin gold section dividers.
Minimalist diagram integrations.

# SECTION I — THE STRUCTURAL QUESTION

Headline:
How Does One Map a Civilizational Corpus?

Opening paragraph:

The Indian śāstric tradition spans thousands of works across multiple knowledge domains, genres, and transmission lineages.  
A meaningful digital system requires more than listing texts — it requires structural mapping.

This page outlines how the Indian Knowledge Library organizes, classifies, and structurally anchors the corpus.

# SECTION II — PRIMARY STRUCTURAL DOMAINS

[STRUCTURED_KNOWLEDGE_TREE_IMAGE]

Headline:
Major Knowledge Classifications

Display structured taxonomy:

Śruti  
Smṛti  
Itihāsa  
Purāṇa  
Āgama / Tantra  
Vedāṅga  
Upaveda  
Darśana  
Sampradāya Traditions  

Brief explanation:

These classifications represent macro-structural domains — not interpretive hierarchies.

Each domain follows distinct structural conventions.

# SECTION III — STRUCTURAL UNIT TYPES

Headline:
Canonical Unit Variations Across Text Types

Create comparison table:

| Text Type | Primary Unit | Structural Depth | Example UID Pattern |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Bhagavad Gītā | Śloka | Chapter → Verse | bg.2.13 |
| Dharma-sūtra | Sūtra | Adhyāya → Sūtra | manu.sm.2.6 |
| Veda | Mantra | Maṇḍala → Sūkta → Mantra | rv.1.1.1 |
| Purāṇa | Śloka | Skandha → Adhyāya → Verse | sb.1.1.1 |

Paragraph:

Canonical identity is adapted to structural type, not forced into uniformity.

# SECTION IV — CANONICAL SPINE APPLICATION

Headline:
Spine Declaration Across Works

Explain:

Each major śāstra requires a declared structural spine.

The spine defines:

• Hierarchical depth  
• Numerical stability  
• UID derivation logic  

[SPINE_DECLARATION_DIAGRAM]

Caption:
Identity derives from structure — not edition.

---

# SECTION V — EDITION VARIANTS & STRUCTURAL STABILITY

Headline:
Managing Variant Traditions Without Identity Drift

Explain:

Different editions may vary in:

• Minor numbering shifts  
• Commentary inclusion  
• Formatting conventions  

But canonical identity remains anchored to declared spine.

Variants are mapped — not merged.

Tone:
Technical.
Clear.
Concise.

# SECTION VI — FUTURE CORPUS EXPANSION

Headline:
From Individual Text to Full Civilizational Coverage

Explain:

Phase 2: Canonical expansion of additional śāstra  
Phase 3+: Layered semantic, interpretive, and educational modeling  

Long-term objective:

Full structural coverage across major śāstric domains.

No timeline promises.
No numerical projections.
Only architectural commitment.

---

# SECTION VII — STRUCTURAL INTEROPERABILITY

Headline:
Preparing for Research Integration

Explain how stable UID enables:

• Cross-text comparison  
• Interdisciplinary modeling  
• Digital humanities analysis  
• Long-term archival durability  

Closing line:

Mapping precedes meaning.
Structure precedes scale.
