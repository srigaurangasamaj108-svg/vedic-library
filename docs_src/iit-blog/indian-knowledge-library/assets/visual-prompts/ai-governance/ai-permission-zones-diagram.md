# AI PERMISSION ZONES DIAGRAM PROMPT  
AI Governance Page — Structural Visual

## Purpose

This diagram visually communicates where AI is permitted and where it is prohibited within the Knowledge Layer Model.

It must reinforce:

• Canonical layer is locked
• AI operates only in upper layers
• Structure governs intelligence

This is not a futuristic AI graphic.
It is a containment diagram.

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create a vertical five-layer stack similar to the Knowledge Layer diagram.

Bottom Layer (Thickest):
CANONICAL

Above:
SEMANTIC

Above:
INTERPRETIVE

Above:
PEDAGOGICAL

Top:
COMMUNITY

## VISUAL DISTINCTION

Canonical Layer:
• Deep indigo
• Subtle lock symbol (minimal, small)
• Slight darker tone than others
• Label: "AI Prohibited"

Upper Four Layers:
• Soft indigo tones
• Label: "AI Assistive Only"

Add subtle side bracket grouping upper four layers labeled:
"AI Operational Zone"

## DESIGN STYLE

• Ivory background
• Thin precise lines
• Clean serif typography
• No gradients
• No 3D
• No glowing effects
• No tech motifs
• No circuit patterns
• No robotic icons

Lock icon must be extremely minimal.
No visual drama.

## VISUAL MESSAGE

AI operates above structure.
Structure remains sovereign.

Authority flows downward.
AI operates upward.

## OUTPUT

High resolution.
Vertical orientation.
Vector clarity.
Minimalist academic tone.
