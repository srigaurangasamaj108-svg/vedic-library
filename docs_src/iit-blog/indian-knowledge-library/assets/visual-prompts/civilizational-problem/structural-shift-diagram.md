# STRUCTURAL SHIFT DIAGRAM PROMPT  
Civilizational Problem Page — Visual Asset

## Purpose

This diagram visually represents the difference between:

1. Fragmented Digital Presentation  
2. Canonical Structural Infrastructure  

It must be calm, structured, and analytical.

It must NOT look dramatic, chaotic, or emotional.

It must look like a research comparison model.
