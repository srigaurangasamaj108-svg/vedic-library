# DECENTRALIZED ECONOMIC CYCLE DIAGRAM PROMPT  
Pillar IV-B — Dharmic Economic Ecology

## Purpose

This diagram visualizes a decentralized economic loop
in which production and distribution
serve ethical continuity and community stability.

It must communicate:

Economic activity is cyclical, accountable, and locally grounded.

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create a circular flow diagram with five equally spaced nodes arranged in a ring.

Clockwise flow:

1. Local Production  
2. Community Processing  
3. Ethical Distribution  
4. Community Support & Welfare  
5. Cultural & Educational Reinforcement  

Arrows move clockwise only.

The cycle must appear stable and continuous.
