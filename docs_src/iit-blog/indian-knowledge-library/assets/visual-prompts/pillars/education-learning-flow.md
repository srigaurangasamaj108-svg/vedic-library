# EDUCATION LEARNING FLOW DIAGRAM PROMPT  
Pillar II — Structured Education Framework

## Purpose

This diagram visualizes how structured learning
emerges from canonical identity
without altering it.

It must communicate:

Education builds outward from text.
It does not replace it.

---

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create a horizontal structured flow diagram:

Canonical Verse  
→ Principle Extraction  
→ Thematic Cluster  
→ Learning Module  
→ Course Track  

Each stage clearly separated by arrows.

---

## VISUAL STRUCTURE

Stage 1:
Canonical Verse  
(Small foundational block — muted gold accent)

Stage 2:
Principle Extraction  
(Soft indigo block)

Stage 3:
Thematic Cluster  
(Light neutral block)

Stage 4:
Learning Module  
(Warm grey block)

Stage 5:
Course Track  
(Light earth tone block)

All blocks aligned on single horizontal axis.

## ARROWS

Thin indigo arrows between blocks labeled:

Derivation

No backward arrows.
No branching complexity.
Keep it clean.

---

## DESIGN STYLE

• Ivory background
• Serif typography
• No gradients
• No glowing effects
• No educational icons (no graduation caps)
• No gamification visuals
• No decorative illustrations

Minimalist academic flow model.

---

## VISUAL MESSAGE

Learning organizes meaning.
Meaning traces back to canon.

---

## CAPTION BELOW

Curriculum emerges from structure — not from abstraction.

---

## OUTPUT

Wide horizontal orientation preferred.
High resolution.
Vector clarity.
Academic diagram aesthetic.
