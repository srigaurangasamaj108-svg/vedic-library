# FIVE-LAYER KNOWLEDGE STACK DIAGRAM PROMPT  
Knowledge Layer Model — Primary Visual

## Purpose

This diagram represents the full Knowledge Layer Model of the Indian Knowledge Library.

It must clearly communicate:

• Layer distinction  
• One-way dependency  
• Downward authority  
• Upward expansion  
• Structural stability  

This is not a marketing pyramid.
It is a containment architecture model.

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create a vertically stacked layered diagram with five horizontal bands.

Bottom Layer (Foundation — Thickest Band):
CANONICAL

Above it (slightly thinner):
SEMANTIC

Above it:
INTERPRETIVE

Above it:
PEDAGOGICAL

Top Layer (Thinnest Band):
COMMUNITY

Each layer clearly separated with thin lines.

## LABELING INSIDE LAYERS

CANONICAL:
Immutable • UID-Anchored • Spine-Bound

SEMANTIC:
Translation • Gloss • Entities • Principles

INTERPRETIVE:
Commentary • Tradition • Comparative Reading

PEDAGOGICAL:
Courses • Lessons • Guided Paths

COMMUNITY:
Discussion • Application • Reflection

## VISUAL INDICATORS

Add subtle downward arrow on right side labeled:
Authority Flow

Add subtle upward arrow on left side labeled:
Expansion Flow

Arrows must be thin and minimal.
Not bold.
Not graphic-heavy.

---

## DESIGN STYLE

• Ivory or white background
• Canonical layer in deep indigo
• Gradually lighter indigo tones upward
• Muted saffron accent line between layers
• Clean serif typography
• No gradients (except extremely subtle tone shift)
• No 3D perspective
• No drop shadows
• No glowing effects
• No icons

Spacing:
Generous vertical spacing.
Perfect symmetry.

Mood:
Structural containment.
Hierarchy.
Intellectual clarity.
Stability across time.

---

## VISUAL MESSAGE

Without separation:
Layers collapse.

With separation:
Plurality thrives without structural erosion.

---

## OUTPUT

High resolution.
Vertical orientation preferred.
Vector-style clarity.
Minimalist academic aesthetic.
