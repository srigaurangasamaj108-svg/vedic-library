# HERO BACKGROUND — REFINED PROMPT  
Indian Knowledge Library — Master Index

## Purpose

The hero background must subtly communicate:

Tradition + Structure + Continuity

It must not:

• Look decorative
• Look devotional
• Look technological
• Look corporate
• Look mythological
• Look like stock parchment

It must feel quiet, intellectual, foundational.

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create a wide horizontal background image with:

Base:
Warm ivory or very soft parchment tone.

Overlay Layer 1 (very subtle):
Faint palm-leaf manuscript texture —
blurred, extremely low opacity (8–12% max).

Overlay Layer 2 (structural layer):
Very faint geometric grid or linear alignment lines —
thin, indigo-grey, barely visible.

The grid must not look like a tech network.
It should resemble architectural drafting lines.

No nodes.
No glowing points.
No digital particle effects.

---

## LIGHTING

Soft top-left diffused light.
Very gentle gradient.
No strong shadows.

---

## COLOR DISCIPLINE

Primary:
Ivory / warm neutral

Secondary:
Muted indigo-grey lines

Accent:
None visible in background.

The gold accent will exist only in section dividers — not here.

---

## COMPOSITION

No focal center.
No heavy vignette.
No visual dominance.

The text must remain fully readable without heavy overlay.

Opacity of all structural elements must remain below 15%.

---

## VISUAL MESSAGE

Tradition rests upon structure.

The background should be felt, not noticed.

---

## OUTPUT

Wide landscape format.
High resolution.
Minimal contrast.
No saturation.
Architectural calm.
