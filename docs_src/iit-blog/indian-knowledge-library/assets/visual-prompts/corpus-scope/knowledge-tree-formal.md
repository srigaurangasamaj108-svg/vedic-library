# STRUCTURED KNOWLEDGE TREE — ELEVATED VERSION

## Purpose

This is not a flat taxonomy chart.
This is a structural organism.

It must show:

Root depth.
Primary branches.
Secondary sub-branches.
Civilizational scale.

But without devotional symbolism.

---

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create a vertically structured tree-form diagram with three visible layers:

LAYER 1 — ROOT FOUNDATION (bottom center)

Label:
Indian Śāstric Corpus

Below it:
Subtle root system spreading horizontally.
Thin muted indigo lines.
Root depth visually visible (not decorative).

Roots must suggest:
Textual continuity across time.

---

LAYER 2 — PRIMARY BRANCHES

From trunk emerge balanced branches labeled:

Śruti  
Smṛti  
Itihāsa  
Purāṇa  
Āgama / Tantra  
Vedāṅga  
Upaveda  
Darśana  
Sampradāya Traditions  

Branches should be gently curved.
Not stiff vertical lines.
Not decorative vines.

Line thickness slightly heavier near trunk,
slightly thinner toward tips.

---

LAYER 3 — SUBTLE SUB-BRANCH INDICATIONS

Under 2–3 main categories,
show faint secondary branching hints (unlabeled).

Example:

Under Śruti → subtle 4 branch hints (Rig, Yajur, Sama, Atharva)
Under Darśana → subtle multiple thin branches
Under Vedāṅga → 6 subtle splits

These must be faint.
Not detailed.
Just indicating depth.

---

## STYLE

Vector illustration.
Muted indigo structural lines.
Soft beige node boxes.
Very slight shadow for depth (3–5%).

No green leaves.
No bark texture.
No mythology.
No ornament vines.

---

## COLOR

Background:
Ivory

Branches:
Deep indigo

Nodes:
Soft parchment beige

---

## VISUAL MESSAGE

This is not a list.
This is a living structural system.

---

## CAPTION

Structured civilizational mapping of the Indian śāstric knowledge universe.

---

High resolution.
Vertical orientation.
Elegant.
Balanced.
Civilizational gravity.
