# IDENTITY VS MEANING — MINI DIAGRAM PROMPT  
Canonical Identity Framework — Supporting Visual

## Purpose

This is a small supporting visual to clarify:

Identity is structural location.
Meaning is interpretive variation.

It must be minimal, elegant, and almost mathematical in clarity.

This is not a colorful infographic.
It is a conceptual distinction diagram.

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create a minimal horizontal diagram with three upper elements converging into one lower anchor.

Top Row (three evenly spaced labels):

• Translation Variations  
• Commentary Variations  
• Interpretive Traditions  

Thin vertical lines descending from each.

All three converge into:

Bottom Center Box:
"bg.2.13"

Below that, small caption text:
Canonical Identity (Structural Location)

---

## DESIGN STYLE

• White or ivory background
• Thin indigo lines
• Minimal muted gold accent for the canonical box
• No gradients
• No shadows
• No 3D
• No icons
• No decorative shapes

Typography:
• Clean serif font
• Small caps for "Canonical Identity"
• Diacritics supported

Spacing:
Generous whitespace.
Centered alignment.
Balanced symmetry.

---

## VISUAL MOOD

The diagram should silently communicate:

Meaning diverges.
Identity converges.

Structural clarity.
Philosophical precision.
Architectural containment.

---

## OUTPUT

Wide horizontal layout.
Vector-style clarity preferred.
High resolution.
