# RESEARCH INTEGRATION LAYER MAP  
Institutional Collaboration — Visual Prompt

## Purpose

This diagram visualizes how academic research domains
interact with the layered knowledge architecture
of the Indian Knowledge Library.

It must communicate:

Research enters at multiple layers,
but canonical identity remains foundational.

---

## STRUCTURE

Design a vertical layered stack in the center of the page:

Top to Bottom:

1. Community Layer  
2. Pedagogical Layer  
3. Interpretive Layer  
4. Semantic Layer  
5. Canonical Layer  

Each layer is a horizontal band.

Bands are evenly spaced.

Subtle separator lines between them.

---

## SIDE CONNECTIONS

On the left and right sides,
place research domain clusters
connected with thin indigo lines to relevant layers.

Example mapping:

Digital Humanities → Semantic + Interpretive layers  
Indology → Canonical + Interpretive layers  
AI & Data Governance → Semantic + Pedagogical layers  
Linguistics → Canonical + Semantic layers  
Civilizational Studies → Interpretive + Community layers  
Information Architecture → All layers  

Lines should be subtle and thin,
not chaotic.

---

## COLOR LANGUAGE

• Canonical Layer: Slightly darker tone (indigo highlight edge)  
• Semantic Layer: Soft muted blue  
• Interpretive Layer: Warm neutral  
• Pedagogical Layer: Light gold tint  
• Community Layer: Very soft earth tone  

No bright colors.
No gradients.
No icons.
No shadows.

Flat academic vector style.

---

## TYPOGRAPHY

Serif font.
Layer titles centered.
Research domain labels small and elegant.

---

## CAPTION BELOW

Layered knowledge architecture supporting interdisciplinary research.

---

## VISUAL MESSAGE

Research may engage at many levels.
Canonical identity remains stable beneath all inquiry.

---

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Vertical orientation preferred.
High resolution.
Vector clarity.
Minimalist academic aesthetic.
No corporate infographic styling.
No startup visuals.
