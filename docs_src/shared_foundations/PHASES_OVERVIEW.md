# 📘 Project Phases Overview
## Vedic Library Project

This document provides a **high-level, authoritative overview** of all
project phases and their intent.

Each phase is **strictly scoped**.
No phase may leak responsibilities into another.

---

## Phase 0 — Preparation & Foundations (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Establish technical, constitutional, and data foundations.

### Achievements
- Initial Bhagavad-gītā data acquisition
- Early JSON normalization experiments
- UID concept prototyping
- Project Constitution authored
- Authority hierarchy defined

📌 This phase was exploratory and is now fully closed.

---

## Phase 1 — Bhagavad-gītā Canonical Pilot (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Prove the feasibility of a read-only canonical scripture library
using a single, fully realized text.

### Scope
- Single śāstra: Bhagavad-gītā
- Fixed canonical structure
- Static, read-only consumption

### Features
- Verse-by-verse canonical display
- Sanskrit (Devanāgarī)
- Transliteration
- Word-for-word synonyms
- English translation
- English purport
- Hindi layers (śloka, śabdārtha, anuvāda, tātparya)
- Language toggles
- Static JSON ingestion (no backend)

📌 Phase-1 is **immutable** and serves as a reference baseline.

---

## Phase 2 — Canonical Expansion & Identity Stress-Test (ACTIVE)

**Goal:** Establish a **universal, edition-safe canonical foundation**
for the entire Vedic corpus.

### Core Responsibilities
- Canonical ingestion of multiple śāstra
- Validation of the universal UID system
- Support for multiple canonical unit types:
  - verse
  - sūtra
  - mantra
  - ritual unit
- Canonical spine declaration
- Witness & variant modeling
- Structural variant handling
- Canonical Ingestion Project (CIP) architecture
- Parallel ingestion discipline
- Zero contamination of canonical identity

### Explicit Exclusions
- ❌ Commentary or bhāṣya
- ❌ Translations
- ❌ Synonyms
- ❌ Knowledge, concepts, or pedagogy
- ❌ Educational UI
- ❌ Search, analytics, or backend APIs
- ❌ Users or personalization

📌 Phase-2 is **architectural and canonical only**.
It prepares the ground for all future meaning layers.

---

## Phase 3 — Derivative & Editorial Layers (PLANNED)

**Goal:** Introduce **non-canonical derivative layers** on top of a
fully locked canonical base.

### Scope
- Translations
- Synonyms
- Expositions / bhāṣya
- Editorial units
- Author and tradition metadata

### Characteristics
- Canon remains immutable
- All derivatives explicitly reference canonical UIDs
- Clear separation of authority layers
- No interpretation generated by AI without attribution

---

## Phase 4 — Knowledge & Educational Systems (PLANNED)

**Goal:** Enable structured understanding and guided study without
compromising canonical integrity.

### Scope
- Concepts and entities
- Thematic navigation
- Educational schemas
- Guided reading paths
- Cross-śāstra linking

📌 All content remains *derivative* and reversible.

---

## Phase 5 — Search, Analysis & Discovery (PLANNED)

**Goal:** Large-scale navigation and analytical access.

### Scope
- Search indices
- Cross-corpus discovery
- Analytical views
- Reference-only query systems

---

## Phase 6 — Community, Teaching & Courses (PLANNED)

**Goal:** Human-centered engagement layered on a stable textual base.

### Scope
- Courses
- Teachers
- Moderation systems
- Community interaction
- Pedagogical tooling

---

## Phase Discipline (Global Rule)

- Each phase must be **completed and locked** before the next begins
- Canonical identity may **never** be retroactively altered
- Later phases may only **reference**, never redefine, earlier layers
