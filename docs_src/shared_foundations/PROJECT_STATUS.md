# Project Status — Vedic Library

**Current Phase:** Phase 2 (Canonical Expansion)

---

## High-Level Status

The Vedic Library project has completed and locked:

- Phase 0 — Foundation & Architecture
- Phase 1 — Canonical Reader & UI Validation

Phase 2 is now active and focuses exclusively on:

- Canonical ingestion of additional śāstra
- Stress-testing the universal UID system
- Validating multiple canonical unit types
- Strengthening architectural and schema guarantees

No commentary, translation, knowledge layers, or educational UX
are permitted in the current phase.

---

## Phase Integrity

- Phase 0 documents are immutable
- Phase 1 documents are immutable
- Phase 2 documents are authoritative for current work

Earlier phase status reports are archived and preserved for reference.
