Very good. Below is the **Chapter 1 Summary text**, written to **strictly obey** the UI behavior and educational boundaries we just locked.

This summary is:

* Retrospective, not interpretive
* Descriptive, not doctrinal
* Calm, not conclusive
* Open-ended, not directive

You may store this as:

## 🧠 Why This Summary Is Correct

This summary:

✔ Recaps events in sequence
✔ Mentions emotions without judging them
✔ Does not resolve Arjuna’s conflict
✔ Does not introduce later philosophy
✔ Does not use “therefore / thus” language
✔ Leaves interpretation entirely open

Most importantly:

> **It helps memory, not meaning.**

---

## 🔒 This Summary Sets the Pattern

All future chapter summaries must:

* Follow this neutral tone
* Avoid conclusions
* Avoid evaluative language
* Respect the reader’s autonomy

If a summary ever feels like “the takeaway,”
it has crossed the line.

### Next calm step (choose one):

1️⃣ Design UI behavior for **Concept & Glossary links**
2️⃣ Draft **Concept explanation (e.g., Dharma)**
3️⃣ Pause and review Phase 4 progress (recommended)

Just tell me the number, dear 🙏
