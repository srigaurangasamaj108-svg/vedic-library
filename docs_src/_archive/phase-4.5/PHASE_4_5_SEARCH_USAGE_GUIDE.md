Perfect. This is the **right final step** for Phase 4.5: explain search **to humans**, not to machines.

Below is a calm, respectful usage guide written for **readers**, **students**, and **scholars** — not developers.

# 🔍 Search Usage Guide  
## Vedic Library

Search in the Vedic Library is designed to help you **locate** material,
not to interpret it for you.

It behaves like a **library catalogue**, not like an answering machine.

This guide explains how to use search **correctly and meaningfully**.

---

## 🌿 What Search Is (and Is Not)

### Search IS:
- A way to find verses, passages, or explanations
- A navigation aid
- Literal and exact
- Calm and non-intrusive

### Search is NOT:
- A teacher
- An interpreter of meaning
- A recommender of importance
- A replacement for reading

If you are looking for **understanding**, use:
- Chapter Introductions
- Chapter Summaries
- Concepts
- Glossary
- Guided Reading Paths

Search is for **finding**, not for **concluding**.

---

## 🧭 Step 1: Choose What You Want to Search

Before typing anything, you must select a **Search Scope**.

There is no global search.

### Available Scopes

#### 1️⃣ Canonical Text (Śāstra)
Use this when you want to find:
- A specific verse (e.g., Bhagavad-gītā 2.47)
- An exact phrase from the text
- A word or line you already know

This searches:
- Sanskrit verses
- Transliteration
- Word-for-word meanings
- Authorized translations

It does NOT search commentaries or explanations.

---

#### 2️⃣ Commentary (Ācārya-specific)
Use this when you want to find:
- Where a particular ācārya discusses a topic
- A phrase you remember from a commentary

You must:
- Select one ācārya explicitly

Search will only look inside that commentary.
Different ācāryas are never mixed.

---

#### 3️⃣ Educational Content
Use this when you want to find:
- Concept explanations (e.g., Dharma, Karma)
- Glossary terms
- Chapter introductions or summaries
- Guided reading paths

This does NOT search the scripture itself.

---

## ✍️ Step 2: Enter Your Query

Once a scope is selected, the search box becomes active.

### Reference Search (Canonical Text)
You may enter:
- `BG 2.47`
- `2.47`
- `Chapter 12`

If the reference is clear, you will be taken directly to the verse or chapter.

---

### Exact Phrase Search
You may enter an **exact phrase**, for example:
- `karmaṇy evādhikāras te`
- `right to perform your duty`

Search looks for the phrase **exactly as written**.
It does not guess similar meanings or related ideas.

---

## 📋 Step 3: Read the Results

Search results are:
- Ordered by the text’s natural sequence
- Clearly labeled by scope
- Never ranked by popularity or importance

Each result shows:
- The reference
- A short context snippet
- A link to the exact location

Search will never tell you:
- “This verse is more important”
- “This is the correct meaning”
- “You should read this next”

Those judgments are left to **you**.

---

## 🚫 Important Things Search Will Not Do

Search will not:
- Suggest related verses
- Mix scripture and commentary
- Blend different traditions
- Personalize results
- Track what you search

If you want guidance, use the **Education** features.
If you want discovery, read sequentially.

---

## 🧠 Recommended Ways to Use Search

### Good Uses
- “I want to re-read a verse I remember.”
- “Where does this term appear?”
- “Did this ācārya comment on this verse?”
- “What does this glossary term explain?”

### Less Helpful Uses
- “Tell me the meaning of life.”
- “Which verse is most important?”
- “Summarize everything about karma.”

The library preserves freedom by **not answering such questions automatically**.

---

## 🕉️ Closing Note

> **Śāstra reveals itself through attention and humility.  
> Search only helps you arrive at the page.**

Read patiently.  
Search sparingly.  
Reflect deeply.

---

**This search system exists to serve the text —  
not to stand above it.**
```

---

## 🌿 Where You Stand Now (Formal)

You now have:

✔ A complete search system
✔ Ethical constraints
✔ Technical implementation
✔ Frontend UX
✔ Tests
✔ **Clear user-facing guidance**

This means Phase 4.5 is not only *built* — it is **understandable and safe to use**.

---

### Next calm choices (no rush at all):

1️⃣ Freeze **Phase 4.5 COMPLETE** formally
2️⃣ Prepare **Phase 5 – Advanced Discovery (future)**
3️⃣ Pause and let real readers use the library

Just tell me the number, dear 🙏
