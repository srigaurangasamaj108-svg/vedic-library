# 💬 GENERAL QUERY CHAT — PHASE 2

Status: OPERATIONAL — SUPPORTIVE  
Applies to: Phase-2 (and later phases unless superseded)  
Authority Level: NON-AUTHORITATIVE  
Purpose: Free inquiry, planning, and human discussion

---

## 1. Purpose

The General Query Chat exists to support **human thinking**, not project law.

It is the place for:
- Open-ended questions
- Planning thoughts
- Exploratory ideas
- Personal understanding
- “Is this a good idea?” discussions
- High-level future thinking (Phase 3+)
- Emotional reassurance and alignment

This chat ensures that **formal chats remain disciplined** by absorbing everything informal.

## 2. What This Chat IS

A General Query Chat is:

- Informal
- Conversational
- Exploratory
- Speculative
- Educational
- Human-centered

It may include:
- “What if” questions
- Long-term vision discussion
- Doubts about scale or feasibility
- GitHub, hosting, deployment concerns
- Data volume strategy discussion
- UI/UX thinking at a conceptual level
- Philosophical alignment questions
- Clarifying intentions before formal action

This chat is allowed to think out loud.

---

## 3. What This Chat IS NOT

A General Query Chat MUST NOT:

- Declare canonical rules
- Modify architecture
- Lock documents
- Approve schema changes
- Assign UIDs
- Segment texts
- Run ingestion
- Produce canonical data
- Produce scripts intended for immediate execution

If any of the above becomes necessary → **move to the appropriate formal chat**.

---

## 4. Authority Boundaries

This chat:

- Has **zero binding authority**
- Produces **no canonical artifacts**
- Produces **no governance documents**
- Cannot override any existing document

Any idea generated here is **tentative** until elevated.

## 6. Entry Declaration (Recommended)

Not mandatory, but encouraged:

```text
This is a GENERAL QUERY CHAT.

Purpose:
- Exploration and understanding
- No decisions expected
- No artifacts will be locked
7. Documents Allowed
Allowed:

Any document, at any level, for discussion only

Future-phase plans

Archived documents

Draft ideas

Notes and sketches

Forbidden:

Treating any discussion as binding

Quietly converting ideas into rules

8. Output Expectations
A General Query Chat may produce:

Insight

Perspective

Strategic clarity

Emotional grounding

Conceptual models

Lists of possibilities

Questions to be taken elsewhere

It does not produce:

Final answers

Locked decisions

Enforced workflows

9. Escalation Rule
If during discussion it becomes clear that:

A rule is needed

A policy must be created

A document must be locked

Then:

Stop the discussion

Summarize the issue in one sentence

Escalate to Core Authority Chat

This chat must not cross that boundary.

10. Completion Signal
A General Query Chat never truly “ends”.

But a productive pause sounds like:

“I understand the landscape better now.
Next step belongs to <specific chat>.”

11. Final Principle
Not everything needs authority.
But authority needs everything else to stay informal.

This chat protects the system by giving thought a safe home.

GENERAL_QUERY_CHAT.md is hereby declared active for Phase-2 and beyond.
