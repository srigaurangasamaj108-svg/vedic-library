# 🧭 CLARIFICATION CHAT — PHASE 2

Status: OPERATIONAL — NORMATIVE  
Applies to: All Phase-2 Work  
Authority Level: NON-AUTHORITATIVE  
Purpose: Understanding only

---

## 1. Purpose

A Clarification Chat exists for **one reason only**:

> To understand existing decisions — not to change them.

This chat is the **only place where confusion is allowed**.

It exists to:
- Prevent silent assumption
- Prevent premature decision-making
- Prevent architectural drift
- Protect canonical integrity

---

## 2. What This Chat IS

A Clarification Chat is:

- Conceptual
- Exploratory
- Explanatory
- Referential

It answers questions like:
- “Why does this rule exist?”
- “What problem does this document solve?”
- “How does this interact with another rule?”
- “Where is this decision actually made?”

This chat produces **clarity**, not output.

---

## 3. What This Chat IS NOT (Absolute Prohibitions)

A Clarification Chat MUST NOT:

- Make decisions
- Modify rules
- Invent conventions
- Override documents
- Approve exceptions
- Assign UIDs
- Segment text
- Emit canonical or editorial data
- Create scripts

If a decision becomes necessary → **STOP**.

---

## 4. Authority Relationship

This chat:

- Is subordinate to Core Authority Chat
- Does not bind future work
- Does not produce artifacts
- Cannot lock documents

Its only valid output is **understanding**.

---

## 5. Required Entry Declaration (Mandatory)

Each Clarification Chat MUST begin with:

```text
This is a CLARIFICATION-ONLY CHAT.

Purpose:
- To understand existing decisions
- No rules will be changed
- No output will be generated

Context of confusion:
<clearly state the question>

I acknowledge:
- PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md is authoritative
- Architecture documents are binding
- This chat has no decision authority
Without this declaration, the chat is invalid.

6. Documents Allowed in This Chat
Allowed (Strict)
ONE document directly relevant to the question

OR a small excerpt from one document

Examples:

STRUCTURAL_VARIANTS_POLICY.md

UID_SYSTEM.md (reference only)

CANONICAL_SPINE_DECLARATION.md

Forbidden in This Chat
❌ Multiple architectural documents
❌ Schemas
❌ Pipeline registries
❌ Phase plans
❌ UI documents
❌ Raw data
❌ Canonical files

If more than one document seems required → you are asking the wrong question.

7. Output Expectations
A Clarification Chat may produce:

Conceptual explanation

Boundary clarification

Terminology alignment

Explicit pointer to the authoritative document

Clear statement of “this is decided elsewhere”

It must NOT produce:

Instructions

Checklists

Files

Schemas

Code

Decisions

8. Escalation Rule
If, during clarification, it becomes clear that:

A rule is missing

A conflict exists

A policy must be created or revised

Then:

This chat MUST STOP

The question must be escalated to the Core Authority Chat

The Clarification Chat MUST NOT propose solutions

9. Completion Signal
A Clarification Chat is complete when:

The confusion is resolved

The authoritative source is identified

No action is taken inside this chat

It should end with a sentence like:

“Clarification complete.
Decision (if any) belongs to the Core Authority Chat.”

10. Final Principle
Confusion is safe.
Decisions are not.

This chat protects the project by keeping those two separate.

CLARIFICATION_CHAT.md is hereby declared normative for Phase-2.
