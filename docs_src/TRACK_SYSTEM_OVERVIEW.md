# 🏛 VEDIC LIBRARY – THREE TRACK ARCHITECTURE SYSTEM

Status: ACTIVE  
Authority: Subordinate only to PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md  
Applies to: All documentation within docs_src  

---

## 0. Purpose

This document defines the structural separation of the Vedic Library into three parallel but independent architectural tracks:

- Track A — Canonical Infrastructure
- Track B — Platform & Interface Engine
- Track C — Civilizational & Institutional Layer

These tracks may evolve in parallel.
They must never collapse into one another.

---

# 🔵 TRACK A — CANONICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

## Purpose

To preserve śāstra structurally and canonically for long-term identity stability.

## Core Question

Can the system hold all Vedic literature without identity collapse?

## Contains

- UID system
- Spine declarations
- Canonical schemas
- Ingestion rules
- Structural variant policy
- Raw-to-canon mapping rules
- Canonical phase reports

## Excludes

- UI decisions
- Deployment logic
- Educational design
- Community features

Track A governs identity and immutability.

---

# 🟢 TRACK B — PLATFORM & INTERFACE ENGINE

## Purpose

To render, navigate, and interact with canonical data without corrupting it.

## Core Question

Can the platform scale across śāstra while preserving calm reading and future extensibility?

## Contains

- Frontend architecture
- UI system documentation
- Scripture engine abstraction
- Routing design
- Deployment records
- Supabase readiness planning

## Excludes

- Canonical law
- Identity decisions
- Institutional theory

Track B governs interaction and experience.

---

# 🟡 TRACK C — CIVILIZATIONAL LAYER

## Purpose

To model how knowledge unfolds beyond text into society.

## Core Question

How does śāstra become lived, taught, and institutionally integrated?

## Contains

- Knowledge Layer Model
- Institutional collaboration plans
- Education model
- Pillars (Library, Education, Guidance, Community)
- IIT engagement materials
- Governance principles

## Excludes

- Schema enforcement
- Routing logic
- Canonical ingestion mechanics

Track C governs purpose and societal interface.

# 🟣 SHARED FOUNDATIONS

Documents that govern all tracks:

- PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md
- Naming conventions
- Identity principles
- Lifecycle rules

Shared foundations override individual tracks in case of conflict.

---

# 🔴 ARCHIVE

Contains superseded, deprecated, or experimental documents.

Archived documents:

- Have no active authority
- Remain for historical traceability
- Cannot override active documents

---

# 1. Parallel Work Model

Track A, B, and C may proceed simultaneously.

No track may modify another track’s domain without formal amendment.

# 3. Long-Term Stability Principle

Track A protects identity.
Track B protects experience.
Track C protects meaning and society.

Their separation prevents corruption.
