Global Header System Specification

---

## 1. Purpose

The Global Header represents the four-pillar architecture:

- Home
- Library
- Education
- Guidance
- Community

It must remain:

- Always visible
- Sticky
- Calm and civilizational
- Expandable

---

## 2. Structural Composition

Component: GlobalHeader.tsx

Layout:

[ Logo ]   Home | Library | Education | Guidance | Community   Search   Login

---

## 3. Dropdown Behavior

Dropdowns are:

- Hover-enabled
- Click-compatible
- State-managed via useState
- Structured per pillar

Future:
- Replace static links with dynamic injection
- Mega menu support
- Corpus-driven injection

---

## 4. Design Constraints

✔ No heavy shadows  
✔ No gradients  
✔ No aggressive animations  
✔ Serif for identity, sans for utility  
✔ Background lighter than library header  

---

## 5. Evolution Path

Phase 6:
- Mega menu
- Dynamic corpus injection
- User dropdown
- Search modal
- Theme toggle

The header is pillar-aware and future-ready.
