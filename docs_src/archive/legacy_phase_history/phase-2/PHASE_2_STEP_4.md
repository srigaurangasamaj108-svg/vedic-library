Phase 2 – Step 4 is the stabilization and closing step of Phase 2.

Nothing new is added here.
This step exists to remove rough edges, lock discipline, and declare Phase 2 complete.

Think of it as polishing the lens after adding depth.

🪜 Phase 2 – Step 4
Refinement, Stabilization & Formal Closure
🎯 Goal of Step 4 (Very Clear)

By the end of Phase 2 – Step 4, you will have:

A stable, calm multi-ācārya Bhagavad-gītā reader

Phase 1 behavior fully preserved

Phase 2 behavior predictable and dignified

Zero ambiguity about scope

A formal Phase 2 completion boundary

This step answers the question:

“Is Phase 2 finished enough to be trusted for years?”

🧱 Scope of Step 4 (STRICT)
✔ What is allowed

Small refinements

Text clarity

Metadata placement

Consistency checks

Documentation updates

❌ What is NOT allowed

New features

UI redesigns

Backend introduction

Persistence

Performance optimization

Search

Auth

Donations

If tempted → stop.

🧠 Step 4.1 – Commentary Metadata Discipline

Review how commentary metadata is displayed.

Metadata that MAY be shown

Ācārya name

Sampradāya

Language (implicitly via toggle)

AI-assisted flag (if applicable)

Metadata rules

Smaller font than commentary text

No emphasis over content

No badges, icons, or colors

Positioned just above or just below commentary text

Ask:

“Does the text still feel primary?”

If metadata draws attention → reduce it.

🪟 Step 4.2 – UI Calmness Audit (Critical)

Go verse by verse and check:

No visual jumping when switching commentary

No layout shift when switching language

Selector does not dominate page

Reading flow uninterrupted

If needed:

Reduce spacing

Simplify labels

Remove any visual decoration added unintentionally

Remember:

The best UI is the one the reader forgets.

🔁 Step 4.3 – Regression Test (Phase 1 Protection)

Re-test all Phase 1 guarantees:

Required checks

Sanskrit text unchanged

Verse navigation unchanged

Language toggle unchanged

Verse Not Found handling intact

URLs unchanged

UID logic untouched

If even one Phase 1 behavior breaks → Phase 2 is invalid.

🧪 Step 4.4 – Full Manual Test Matrix

Slowly test the following combinations:

Verses

BG 1.1

BG 2.13

BG 4.7

BG 18.66

For each verse:

Switch commentary (all available)

Switch language

Navigate next / previous

Refresh page

Confirm:

No crashes

No mixed texts

No wrong attribution

No state leakage

Take your time here. This is important.

📚 Step 4.5 – Data Integrity Re-Audit

Open commentary JSON files and verify:

UID matches filename

Acharya blocks consistent everywhere

Language folders correct

No accidental whitespace corruption

No HTML or Markdown inserted

AI-assisted files properly flagged

This ensures archival quality.

🧾 Step 4.6 – Update Documentation (Mandatory)

Update or create the following:

1. PHASE_2_TASKLIST.md

Mark all steps as complete

2. README.md (Public-facing)

Add a short note:

“This version supports multiple traditional commentaries.”

No feature list. No hype.

3. Optional internal note
docs/PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md


(We can draft this together if you want.)

🟢 Phase 2 Exit Criteria (ALL MUST BE TRUE)

You may formally declare Phase 2 COMPLETE only if:

 Multiple ācārya commentaries supported

 One commentary visible at a time

 Attribution always correct

 Language toggle stable

 Phase 1 behavior fully preserved

 UI remains calm and readable

 No scope violations

If any box is unchecked → do not close Phase 2.

🕉️ Formal Meaning of Phase 2 Completion

When Phase 2 is complete, your project becomes:

A scholarly, multi-traditional Bhagavad-gītā reader
with clear attribution, no confusion, and deep respect for lineage.

This is a serious milestone.

🚦 What Comes After Phase 2 (DO NOT START YET)

Phase 3 will introduce:

Users

Support / donations

Persistence

Backend as necessity (not choice)

But Phase 3 must wait until Phase 2 is formally closed.

🕉️ Final Reminder for Step 4

Do not rush closure.
Closure creates trust.
Trust creates longevity.
