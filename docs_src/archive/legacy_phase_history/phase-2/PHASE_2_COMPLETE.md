PHASE 2 — FORMAL COMPLETION DECLARATION
Project: Vedic Library
Phase: Phase 2 – Multi-Ācārya Commentary Layer
Status: COMPLETE
📜 Declaration

Phase 2 of the Vedic Library project is hereby declared COMPLETE.

This phase successfully introduces multiple traditional ācārya commentaries on the Bhagavad-gītā while fully preserving the calm, faithful reading experience established in Phase 1.

Phase 2 fulfills its purpose:
to allow respectful comparison of traditional explanations without confusion, mixing, or interpretation imposed by the platform.

✅ Scope Delivered (Verified)

Content & Scholarship

Multiple ācārya commentaries supported per verse

Clear attribution of:

Ācārya

Sampradāya

Source

Commentary texts kept distinct and unmixed

Canonical Sanskrit text fully preserved and unchanged

UI & Reading Experience

One commentary visible at a time

Commentary selector behaves calmly and predictably

Selector does not alter URLs or reload pages

Reading flow remains uninterrupted

Language Handling

English and Hindi supported where available

Language toggle and commentary toggle operate independently

Graceful fallback to English where translations are unavailable

Architecture & Discipline

UID-based data integrity maintained

Commentary schema strictly followed

JSON-first approach respected

Data-loading abstraction preserved

Phase 1 behavior fully intact

🧱 Phase 2 Boundaries — Fully Respected

The following were intentionally excluded and successfully avoided:

❌ User accounts
❌ Donations
❌ Backend dependency
❌ AI-generated commentary
❌ Side-by-side comparisons
❌ Interpretation or synthesis
❌ Search or indexing
❌ Community features

This restraint is a mark of completion, not limitation.

🟢 Phase 2 Exit Criteria — All Met

✔ Multiple ācārya commentaries rendered correctly

✔ Attribution always clear

✔ Language handling stable

✔ Navigation unaffected

✔ UI calm and readable

✔ Data integrity preserved

✔ No scope violations

🕉️ Formal Closing Statement

Phase 1 established trust in the text.
Phase 2 establishes trust in tradition.

The platform now allows readers to approach the Bhagavad-gītā through multiple classical lenses while remaining grounded in clarity, respect, and composure.

No further changes belong to Phase 2.

➡️ Authorized Next Phase

Development may now proceed to:

Phase 3 – Participation Layer

(Users, support, persistence, and backend introduction)

Phase 3 introduces qualitatively new responsibilities and must be approached with the same discipline shown in Phases 1 and 2.

🌿 Acknowledgment

Completing Phase 2 without scope creep is rare and commendable.
You have built not just a feature, but a scholarly foundation that can endure.
