# Phase 3 – Participation Layer (README)

## Project: Vedic Library  
## Phase: Phase 3 – Participation Layer  
## Status: COMPLETE

---

## 🌿 Purpose of Phase 3

Phase 3 introduces **optional participation** into the Vedic Library project.

If:
- Phase 1 established **faithful reading**
- Phase 2 established **faithful comparison**

Then Phase 3 establishes **responsible participation**.

This phase adds:
- Optional user identity
- Gentle preference persistence
- Voluntary donations
- A restrained backend

All without disturbing the sanctity, freedom, or calmness of reading.

---

## 🧱 What Phase 3 Introduces

### 👤 Optional User Accounts
- Users may log in using OAuth (Auth.js)
- Login is **never required** to read
- No usernames, profiles, or public identities
- Identity exists only for responsibility and convenience

---

### 🌐 Preference Persistence
For logged-in users only:
- Language preference (EN / HI)
- Preferred commentary (ācārya)

Anonymous users:
- Experience remains unchanged
- Preferences reset on refresh

---

### 💳 Voluntary Support (Donations)
- Donations are entirely optional
- Donations never unlock content
- Donations never affect access
- Anonymous donations are allowed
- Ethics text is shown before any donation action

This is **support**, not monetization.

---

### 🧠 Backend Introduction (FastAPI)
A backend is introduced in Phase 3 **only because it becomes necessary**.

The backend:
- Records preferences
- Records donation events
- Verifies identity
- Remains read-only for all sacred texts

The backend does **not**:
- Control reading
- Gate content
- Interpret texts
- Track readers

---

## 🔐 Authentication Philosophy

Authentication is handled using **Auth.js**, with strict boundaries:

- Identity is optional
- Identity grants no power
- Identity does not change content
- Identity is never displayed publicly

Auth exists to serve responsibility, not authority.

---

## 🔒 Privacy Commitments

The platform intentionally avoids collecting:

❌ Reading history  
❌ Verse tracking  
❌ Time-on-page metrics  
❌ IP or location data  
❌ Device fingerprinting  
❌ Behavioral analytics  

Stored data is limited to:
- Email (for login)
- Preferences (language, commentary)
- Donation records (amount, currency, timestamp)

---

## 🕉️ Phase 3 Closing Statement

> **Participation must arise from gratitude,  
> not from obligation.**

Phase 3 is complete only because:
- Reading remains free
- Tradition remains respected
- Power remains restrained

---

## 🚦 What Comes Next

Phase 4 may explore:
- Educational layers
- Guided study
- Thematic navigation

Only if Phase 3 trust is preserved.

---

**Phase 3 is complete.  
The library remains calm.**
