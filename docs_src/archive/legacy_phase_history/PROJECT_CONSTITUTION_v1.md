# 📜 Project Constitution: Vedic Library

## Vision
Vedic Library is a long-term digital platform for preserving, presenting, and analyzing the entire corpus of Vedic literature.

The project prioritizes:
- Textual accuracy
- Scholarly integrity
- Calm, phase-wise growth
- Independence from proprietary platforms
- Scalability across centuries of literature

This is not a startup experiment, but a civilizational knowledge archive.

## Pilot Scope (Non-Negotiable)
- ONLY Bhagavad-gītā in Phase 1
- No other śāstra until Phase 1 is complete and stable

---

## Core Principles
1. Data-first, UI-second
2. Canonical text is immutable
3. Interpretation layers are additive
4. Frameworks may change; data must survive
5. Simple now, expandable later
6. No over-engineering
7. Budget grows only with usage and need

---

## Technology Spine (Fixed)
- Frontend: Next.js (React-based)
- UI Paradigm: React Components
- Backend Logic: Python (FastAPI)
- Data Source: JSON-first → Database later
- Authentication (phased): Auth.js → Supabase Auth → Firebase Auth
- Database (later): PostgreSQL
- Hosting (initial): Local + GitHub Pages
- Domain: Already owned

---

## Language Strategy
- Phase 1: English (source) + Hindi (AI-assisted)
- Future: Other Indian & global languages
- AI translations are aids, not authorities

---

## Governance
- Canonical text is never overwritten
- AI output is always tagged as AI-generated
- Human review remains possible at every layer

---

## Long-Term Scope (Future Phases)
- Śruti
- Smṛti
- Purāṇa
