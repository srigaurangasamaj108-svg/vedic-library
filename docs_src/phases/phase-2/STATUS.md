# 📊 Phase 2 — Status Ledger
## Vedic Library Project

---

## Phase Identity

- **Phase:** 2
- **Name:** Canonical Expansion
- **Primary Objective:** Multi-śāstra canonical ingestion
- **Depends on:** Phase 1 (v1.0-pilot — Bhagavad-gītā)
- **Prepares for:** Phase 3 (Derivatives & Interpretive Layers)
- **Current State:** 🟡 ACTIVE (Execution Enabled)

---

## Phase Mandate (Non-Negotiable)

Phase-2 exists **only** to:

- Expand the canonical corpus across śāstra
- Validate UID universality at scale
- Ingest texts mechanically via Canonical Ingestion Projects (CIPs)
- Preserve canonical identity independent of editions, witnesses, or traditions

Phase-2 is **architectural and canonical**, not educational or interpretive.

---

## Lock Status

### 🔒 Constitutionally Locked (Inherited or Finalized)

The following are **immutable** for the remainder of Phase-2:

#### Constitutional Law
- `PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md`
- `DOCUMENT_AUTHORITY_HIERARCHY.md`
- `CANONICAL_TEXT_POLICY.md`
- `CANONICAL_IDENTITY_PRINCIPLES.md`
- `CANONICAL_IDENTITY_DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md`

#### Canonical & Structural Architecture
- `UID_SYSTEM.md`
- `UID_REFINEMENT_RULES.md`
- `CANONICAL_UNIT_DEFINITION.md`
- `VERSE_REFERENCE_CONTRACT.md`
- `STRUCTURAL_VARIANTS_POLICY.md`
- `CANONICAL_SPINE_DECLARATION.md`
- `WITNESS_AND_VARIANT_MODEL.md`

#### Ingestion Law (CIP)
- `RAW_TO_CANONICAL_MAPPING_POLICY.md`
- `CANONICAL_INGESTION_PROJECT_STANDARD.md`
- `CIP_ROOT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `CIP_LEAF_STANDARD.md`
- `RAW_LAYER_SEMANTICS.md`
- `PIPELINE_SCRIPT_CONTRACT.md`
- `CANONICAL_HANDOFF_AND_VAULTING.md`
- `REGISTRY_AND_GOVERNANCE_INTEGRATION.md`

#### Chat System (Phase-2)
- Chat Manifests under `docs_src/chat-manifests/phase-2/`
- Chat Prompts under `docs_src/chat-prompts/phase-2/`

No re-debate or redesign of the above is permitted.

---

## 🔓 Permitted Activity (Phase-2 Scope)

The following activities are allowed **only within defined boundaries**:

- Creation of new Canonical Ingestion Projects (CIPs)
- Pipeline execution up to `04_canonical/`
- Canonical unit emission (verse / sūtra / mantra / ritual)
- Canonical spine declarations for new śāstra
- Witness and variant mapping (non-canonical metadata)
- UID registration for *new* canonical units (append-only)

All such work must flow through:
**Pipeline Chat → Canonical Chat → Registry Update**

---

## 🚫 Explicit Phase-2 Exclusions (Strict)

The following are **not allowed** in Phase-2:

- Commentary, bhāṣya, ṭīkā, exposition
- Translations, glosses, synonyms
- Knowledge layers (concepts, entities, principles)
- Educational or teaching UX
- Search, analytics, or discovery systems
- Backend APIs or persistence layers
- AI-generated interpretive content

Any inclusion of the above constitutes a **Phase Breach**.

---

## Current Execution Mode

Phase-2 is now in **distributed execution mode**, characterized by:

- Multiple concurrent **Pipeline Script Chats**
- Multiple **Text-Specific Canonical Chats**
- A single active **Core Authority Chat** at any given time
- Escalations routed via **Clarification Chats**

Continuity between Core Authority Chats is preserved exclusively through:

- `CORE_AUTHORITY_HANDOFF.md`
- This `STATUS.md`

---

## Active Focus Areas

- Purāṇa ingestion (Padma-Purāṇa and others)
- Smṛti ingestion (Manu-Smṛti and related texts)
- Stress-testing canonical spine + witness separation
- Scaling CIP folder architecture across corpora
- Validating UID stability under structural variance

---

## Next Allowed Actions

The following actions are currently permitted:

1. Initiate new **Pipeline Script Chats** for additional śāstra
2. Proceed with **Canonical Chats** once pipeline output reaches `04_canonical/`
3. Append new entries to:
   - UID registry
   - Pipeline registry
4. Update this file **only** when:
   - Phase state changes
   - Lock status changes
   - Phase-2 is formally completed

---

## Status Update Rule (Strict)

This file is a **factual ledger**, not a planning document.

It may be updated **only** to reflect:

- Objective progress
- Lock transitions
- Formal completion of Phase-2

Speculative plans, future phases, or architectural ideas must not appear here.

---

## Formal Statement

Phase-2 is **architecturally complete**, **procedurally locked**, and **actively executing**.

All further work must comply with the law recorded above.

End of Status.
