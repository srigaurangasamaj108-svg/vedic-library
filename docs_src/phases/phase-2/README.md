# 🚧 Phase 2 — Canonical Expansion

## Vedic Library Project

Vedic Library has completed **Phase 1 (v1.0-pilot)** — a stable, read-only
canonical presentation of the **Bhagavad-gītā**.

The project is now in **Phase 2**, focused exclusively on:

- Canonical ingestion of **additional śāstra**
- Validation of the **universal UID system**
- Support for **multiple canonical unit types**
  (verse, sūtra, mantra, ritual unit)
- Strengthening schema, policy, and architectural foundations

---

## Important Boundaries (Strict)

Phase 2 explicitly does **not** include:

- ❌ Commentary layers (ācārya or modern)
- ❌ Knowledge or teaching overlays
- ❌ Concepts, entities, principles, guidance
- ❌ User accounts or personalization
- ❌ Interpretive UI changes
- ❌ Search, analytics, or community features

Phase 2 is **architectural and canonical**, not educational.

---

## Phase Discipline

- Phase 1 remains **fully locked and immutable**
- No Phase-3 concerns may leak into Phase-2
- All work here must respect canonical identity first

---

## Why This README Exists

This README exists to:

- Signal a clear phase transition
- Prevent premature feature expectations
- Reassure that Phase-1 will not change
- Anchor contributors to correct scope

This document is **descriptive**, not prescriptive.  
Operational status is tracked separately in `STATUS.md`.

Phase-2 may begin only after satisfying
docs/governance/PHASE_2_ENTRY_CHECKLIST.md
