## 📜 Declaration

Phase 1 of the Vedic Library project is hereby declared **COMPLETE**.

This phase successfully establishes a faithful, stable, and dignified
digital reader for the Bhagavad-gītā, modeled on the Vedabase reading
experience and built with long-term architectural discipline.

Phase 1 fulfills its purpose:  
to enable calm, uninterrupted reading of śāstra, without distraction,
manipulation, or premature complexity.
