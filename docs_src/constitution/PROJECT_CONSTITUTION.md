Vedic Library Project

Version: 2.2.0
Status: CONSTITUTIONAL — LOCKED
Authority Level: Supreme (overrides all other documents)

Preamble

The Vedic Library is a long-term civilizational project dedicated to the faithful preservation, structural clarity, and dignified presentation of Vedic and allied śāstric literature.

This project exists to serve reading before speaking, understanding before interpretation, and truth before technology.

This Constitution defines what the project is, what it is not, and how authority is resolved, so that the library remains trustworthy not only today, but across generations.

1. Purpose & Ethos
1.1 Purpose

The Vedic Library exists to:

Preserve canonical śāstra in structurally correct digital form

Enable calm, uninterrupted reading

Provide a stable foundation for layered study without distorting identity

Serve humanity without commercial, ideological, or algorithmic coercion

1.2 Ethos

The project is guided by:

Reverence for textual integrity

Intellectual humility before tradition

Restraint over feature accumulation

Clarity over cleverness

Stability over novelty

2. Scope & Phase Discipline
2.1 Phase-Based Development

The project evolves in explicit, locked phases.

Each phase must be fully completed and closed before the next begins.
No phase may retroactively alter constitutional foundations.

2.2 Phase Authority

Earlier phases define identity

Later phases may extend, but never invalidate, earlier decisions

No phase may assume permissions granted only to later phases

3. Canonical Identity (Core Principle)
3.1 Definition

Canonical identity is the structural identity of a textual unit, determined by its traditional position.

Canonical identity is:

Structural, not semantic

Language-independent

Tradition-derived

Immutable once locked

3.2 What Canonical Identity Is Not

Canonical identity does not encode:

Translation

Commentary

Philosophy

Sampradāya

Pedagogy

UI structure

Technology

Identity exists prior to all of these.

4. Canonical Units
4.1 Definition

A canonical unit is the smallest traditionally recognized textual unit of a śāstra.

Examples include:

Śloka

Sūtra

Mantra

Ritual unit

Kārikā

4.2 Unit Authority

Canonical units are determined by:

Traditional structure

Conservative alignment with critical editions

Minimal, non-speculative segmentation

Canonical units may not be subdivided, merged, or reshaped for convenience.

5. UID & Addressing Principles
5.1 UID as a Constitutional Instrument

A UID (Universal Identifier):

Encodes location, not meaning

Is stable across time, tools, and presentation layers

Never changes once assigned

Exists independently of file paths or UI routes

5.2 UID Refinement

Refinements may reference ranges or groupings but must never alter base identity.

Technical details are delegated to UID_SYSTEM.md.

6. Canonical Text Integrity
6.1 Canonical Text

Canonical text consists of:

Primary authoritative script

Mechanically derived aligned forms

Canonical text must be:

Free of interpretation

Free of explanation

Free of translation

Free of commentary

6.2 Immutability

Once canonical text is locked:

It must never be edited

Corrections require a new canonical version

Downstream layers must adapt

7. Separation of Layers
7.1 Mandatory Separation

The system enforces strict separation between:

Canonical layer

Editorial layer

Knowledge layers

Pedagogical layers

Community layers

UI layers

No layer may contaminate another.

7.2 Direction of Dependency

Dependency flows downward only:

Canonical → Editorial → Knowledge → UI → Community

Never the reverse.

8. AI-Assisted Content (Constitutional Policy)

AI is permitted only as a subordinate instrument.

AI:

Is never authoritative

Is never canonical

Is never self-validating

AI may never:

Generate or modify canonical text

Decide canonical identity or UID assignment

Infer missing canonical content

All AI-assisted content must be declared, auditable, and human-reviewed.

Canonical layers must remain AI-independent forever.

9. Knowledge Expansion Philosophy

Knowledge expansions:

Attach to canonical identity

Never redefine identity

Are plural, optional, and non-authoritative

Meaning grows around canon, never inside it.

10. UX & Reading Ethics
10.1 Reading Comes First

UI must prioritize:

Calm reading

Structural clarity

Minimal distraction

10.2 Prohibited UX Patterns

The project forbids:

Dark patterns

Algorithmic addiction

Forced engagement

Paywalls around canonical text

11. Governance & Decision Rules
11.1 Conflict Resolution Hierarchy

When ambiguity arises, resolution follows:

Traditional structure

Canonical identity principles

Conservative minimality

Future reversibility

UI convenience is never decisive.

11.2 Authority

Once documented and locked, architectural decisions are binding.
Ad-hoc exceptions are forbidden.

11.3 Reference-Based Authority Principle

Authority within the Vedic Library Project is enforced by reference, not repetition. All canonical, architectural, and governance decisions are bound to formally declared authoritative documents whose location, status, and lock-state are explicit. Chats, tools, contributors, and processes are governed by acknowledging these documents by reference, without requiring their contents to be re-pasted, re-interpreted, or re-negotiated. No decision-making authority may be inferred from memory, prompt length, or conversational continuity. If a document is declared authoritative and locked, it governs all work regardless of whether it is restated. Continuity across phases and chats is preserved through documentation, not conversation history.

12. Relationship to Other Documents

This Constitution delegates detail to binding documents, including:

CANONICAL_TEXT_POLICY.md

CANONICAL_UNIT_DEFINITION.md

UID_SYSTEM.md

UID_REFINEMENT_RULES.md

DATA_SCHEMA.md

If any document conflicts with this Constitution, this document prevails.

13. Final Declaration

The Vedic Library is not a product.
It is not a platform.
It is not an opinion.

It is a library.

Canonical text is truth.
Commentary is guidance.
Knowledge is service.
Technology is a servant, never a master.

This Constitution exists so the library remains worthy of trust —
today, tomorrow, and long after its creators are gone.
