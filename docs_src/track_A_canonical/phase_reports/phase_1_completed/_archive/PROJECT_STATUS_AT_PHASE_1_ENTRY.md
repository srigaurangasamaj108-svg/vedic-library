# Project Status — Vedic Library

**Current Phase:** Phase 1 (Initiation)

---

## Summary

Phase 0 (Foundation & Architecture) has been completed and formally closed.

All foundational elements — including canonical data, editorial modeling,
derivative pipelines, validation, and governance documents — are stable and frozen.

The project is now transitioning into **Phase 1**, which focuses on
frontend exploration and user-facing reading interfaces,
built strictly on top of the Phase-0 foundation.

No frontend or backend implementation has begun yet.
