# 🧱 TEXT-SPECIFIC CANONICAL CHAT — PHASE 2

Status: OPERATIONAL — NORMATIVE  
Applies to: Phase 2 Canonical Expansion  
Authority Level: Subordinate to Core Authority Chat  
Scope: One śāstra only

---

## 1. Purpose

A Text-Specific Canonical Chat exists to:

- Canonically ingest **one and only one śāstra**
- Apply already-locked Phase-2 law **mechanically**
- Convert normalized text into **canonical units**
- Bind canonical units to **UIDs**
- Produce schema-valid canonical JSON
- Prepare canonical data for vaulting into `vedic-library-v1.0/data/`

This chat is a **scribe**, not a lawgiver.

---

## 2. Absolute Scope Constraint

A Text-Specific Canonical Chat is bound to:

> **Exactly one śāstra.  
> Exactly one declared canonical spine.**

Examples:
- Padma Purāṇa (only)
- Manu-smṛti (only)
- Ṛg-veda Saṁhitā (only)

Mixing śāstra is constitutionally forbidden.

---

## 3. Authority Relationship

This chat:

- MUST obey all locked Phase-2 documents
- MUST escalate ambiguity to the Core Authority Chat
- MUST NOT invent, reinterpret, or “patch” rules

If a decision is required → **STOP**

---

## 4. What This Chat MAY Do

This chat MAY:

- Apply existing UID grammar
- Apply canonical unit definitions
- Apply a declared canonical spine
- Segment verses / sūtras / mantras / ritual units
- Bind canonical units to UIDs
- Produce canonical JSON files
- Validate output against schemas
- Prepare handoff notes for pipeline vaulting

All actions must be **mechanical applications of law**, not interpretations.

---

## 5. What This Chat MUST NOT Do (Absolute Prohibitions)

This chat MUST NOT:

- Redesign UID systems
- Modify schemas
- Introduce new canonical unit types
- Invent naming conventions
- Decide verse or unit boundaries independently
- Introduce translations, glosses, or commentary
- Infer structure from UI, websites, or hyperlinks
- Resolve textual ambiguity autonomously

Any such act is a **canonical breach**.

---

## 6. Required Entry Declaration (Mandatory)

Each Text-Specific Canonical Chat MUST begin with:

```text
This is a TEXT-SPECIFIC CANONICAL CHAT.

Śāstra under consideration:
<exact name>

Declared canonical spine:
<spine id>

Scope:
- Canonical ingestion ONLY
- One śāstra only
- No interpretation, no translation, no commentary

Authority acknowledgment:
- PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md is LOCKED
- Phase-2 architecture documents are LOCKED
- UID system is LOCKED
- Canonical schemas are LOCKED
Without this declaration, the chat has no authority.

7. Required Documents to Paste (Strict Order)
Tier 1 — Canonical Law (ALWAYS REQUIRED)
PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md

CANONICAL_TEXT_POLICY.md

CANONICAL_UNIT_DEFINITION.md

UID_SYSTEM.md

STRUCTURAL_VARIANTS_POLICY.md

Tier 2 — Ingestion Discipline
RAW_TO_CANONICAL_MAPPING_POLICY.md

CANONICAL_INGESTION_PROJECT_STANDARD.md

CANONICAL_SPINE_DECLARATION.md (relevant entry)

Tier 3 — Schemas (ONLY what applies)
Verse texts:

canonical-verse.schema.md

verse-index.schema.md

Sūtra texts:

canonical-sutra.schema.md

Mantra texts:

canonical-mantra.schema.md

Ritual texts:

canonical-ritual-unit.schema.md

❌ Never paste knowledge-layer schemas
❌ Never paste editorial schemas
❌ Never paste pipeline registry

8. Interaction with Pipeline Chat
This chat:

Receives normalized text from the Pipeline Chat

Applies canonical structure and UID binding

Produces canonical JSON

Does NOT scrape, normalize, or fetch raw text

Pipeline ≠ Canonical
Mechanism ≠ Identity

9. Escalation Rule (Non-Negotiable)
If the chat encounters:

Structural ambiguity

Numbering inconsistency

Spine conflict

Source disagreement

Boundary uncertainty

It MUST:

STOP processing

Document the ambiguity

Escalate to Core Authority Chat

Continuing without escalation is forbidden.

10. Completion Criteria
A Text-Specific Canonical Chat is complete only when:

Canonical units pass schema validation

UID assignments are consistent and logged

No unresolved ambiguity remains

A handoff note is prepared for pipeline vaulting

The chat must then explicitly declare:

“Canonical ingestion complete.
Ready for vaulting.”

11. Final Principle
This chat preserves identity.
It does not explain meaning.

Text-Specific Canonical Chats protect the dignity of śāstra by refusing to interpret.

TEXT_SPECIFIC_CANONICAL_CHAT.md is hereby declared normative for Phase-2.
