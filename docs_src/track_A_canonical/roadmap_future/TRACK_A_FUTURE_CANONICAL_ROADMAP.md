# 🏛 Track A — Canonical Infrastructure Roadmap
## Vedic Library Project

---

## Status

Track: A  
Domain: Canonical Identity & Structural Integrity  
Authority Level: Highest (Subordinate only to Constitution)

---

## 0. Purpose

Track A governs:

- Canonical identity
- Spine declaration
- UID system
- Schema discipline
- Ingestion law
- Long-term textual stability

Track A does NOT govern:

- UI
- Commentary
- Pedagogy
- Community
- Authentication
- Search
- Infrastructure scaling

---

## 1. Completed Phases

### Phase 0 — Structural Reset
- Canonical-first philosophy declared
- UID discipline introduced
- Canonical vs Extended separation established

### Phase 1 — Canonical Verse Stabilization
- Bhagavad-gītā canonical ingestion validated
- UID immutability confirmed
- Canonical schema locked
- Reader isolation enforced

---

## 2. Phase 2 — Canonical Expansion (ACTIVE)

Objective:

Prove that the canonical system can host multiple śāstra types without structural collapse.

Includes:

- Multi-śāstra ingestion
- Canonical unit diversity:
  - Verse
  - Sūtra
  - Mantra
  - Ritual units
- Spine declaration stress testing
- UID universality validation

Exit Criteria:

- Multiple canonical unit types coexist
- UID stability confirmed
- No commentary contamination
- Reader remains canon-only

---

## 3. Future Canonical Phases

### Phase 3 — Structural Variants & Witness Model

- Formalize witness handling
- Variant mapping to spine
- Manuscript distinction without UID instability

### Phase 4 — Canonical Corpus Scaling

- Large corpus ingestion (Purāṇa scale)
- Memory optimization strategy
- Canonical vaulting system refinement

### Phase 5 — Distributed Canonical Governance

- Multi-team ingestion model
- CIP governance protocol refinement
- Canonical registry decentralization

---

## 4. Permanent Invariants

The following are never negotiable:

- UID immutability
- Spine immutability
- Canonical schema discipline
- Layer separation (Canonical vs Extended)
- No semantic leakage into canonical layer

---

## 5. Architectural Principle

Track A is not expressive.

It is custodial.

Its success is measured not by features,
but by the absence of corruption.
