# 🟡 Track C — Civilizational Expansion
## Vedic Library Project

---

## Status

Track: C  
Domain: Education, Community, Institutional Framework  
Authority Level: Subordinate to Track A & Track B

---

## 0. Purpose

Track C governs the living application of canon.

It includes:

- Educational frameworks
- Guided learning paths
- Community systems
- Institutional collaboration
- Civilizational modeling

Track C does not govern:

- Canonical identity (Track A)
- Rendering engine (Track B)

---

## 1. Civilizational Philosophy

Canon preserves truth.  
Platform renders it.  
Track C activates it.

Track C is where śāstra becomes lived structure.

---

## 2. Education Layer

Location:
`education/`

Includes:

- Course schema
- Lesson schema
- Teacher schema
- Guided path schema
- Reading path systems

Education must:

- Reference canonical UID
- Never rewrite canonical meaning
- Preserve attribution
- Maintain layer discipline

---

## 3. Guidance Layer

Location:
`guidance/`

Future Goals:

- Problem-to-verse mapping
- Context-based reading assistance
- Applied dharmic frameworks
- Situational guidance models

Guidance must:

- Cite canonical UID
- Declare interpretive layer
- Never assert canonical authority

---

## 4. Community Layer

Location:
`community/`

Future Systems:

- Discussion
- Reflections
- Moderated Q&A
- Shared annotations (non-authoritative)

Community layer authority:
Experiential only.

Never doctrinal.

---

## 5. Institutional Layer

Location:
`institutional/`

Includes:

- Constitutional documents
- Governance principles
- Authority hierarchy
- Collaboration models
- Digital dharmic infrastructure

This layer defines:

How the Vedic Library operates as an institution.

---

## 6. Pillars

Location:
`pillars/`

Represents long-term civilizational expansion:

- Canonical Digital Infrastructure
- Structured Education Framework
- Living Civilizational Model
- Dharmic Economic Ecology
- Applied Guidance Systems

---

## 7. Long-Term Vision

Track C ultimately supports:

- Temple integration
- Educational institutions
- Scholarly collaboration
- Decentralized canonical ingestion
- Global dharmic access

---

## 8. Authority Flow

Track C depends on:

Track A (Canonical Identity)  
Track B (Platform Engine)

Track C may expand infinitely.  
But it must never compromise lower layers.

---

## 9. Final Principle

Track A guards truth.  
Track B renders truth.  
Track C transmits truth.

All three must remain distinct.
