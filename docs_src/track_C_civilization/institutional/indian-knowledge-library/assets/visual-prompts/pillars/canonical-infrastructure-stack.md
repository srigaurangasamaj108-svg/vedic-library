# CANONICAL INFRASTRUCTURE STACK DIAGRAM PROMPT  
Pillar I — Canonical Digital Infrastructure

## Purpose

This diagram visually represents the structural stack
that defines canonical digital infrastructure.

It must communicate:

Identity before interpretation.
Structure before presentation.
Foundation before expansion.

---

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create a clean vertical stacked diagram with five aligned layers.

Top to Bottom:

Presentation Layer  
Interpretive Layer  
Semantic Layer  
Canonical Identity Layer  
Canonical Text Layer (Foundation)

---

## INTERNAL LABELS

Presentation Layer:
• UI
• Navigation
• Search
• Rendering

Interpretive Layer:
• Commentary
• Comparative Analysis
• Traditions

Semantic Layer:
• Translation
• Gloss
• Entities
• Concepts

Canonical Identity Layer:
• UID
• Spine Declaration
• Structural Coordinates

Canonical Text Layer:
• Devanāgarī Text
• Mechanical Transliteration
• Immutable Canon

---

## VISUAL STRUCTURE

• Perfectly aligned vertical blocks
• Thin indigo borders
• Muted gold highlight for Canonical Text Layer
• Slightly thicker base foundation block
• Clean horizontal separation lines

Add small downward arrows between blocks labeled:
"Depends On"

No upward arrows.

---

## COLOR LANGUAGE

Canonical Text:
Muted gold

Identity Layer:
Soft indigo

Semantic Layer:
Light neutral grey

Interpretive Layer:
Very light indigo

Presentation Layer:
Soft neutral tone

All colors muted.
No saturation.

---

## DESIGN STYLE

• Ivory background
• Serif typography
• No gradients
• No glow
• No drop shadows
• No 3D perspective
• No icons except minimal structural arrows

Architectural clarity only.

---

## VISUAL MESSAGE

Higher layers change.
Foundation does not.

---

## CAPTION BELOW

Identity anchors expansion.

---

## OUTPUT

Vertical orientation preferred.
High resolution.
Vector clarity.
Academic architectural aesthetic.
