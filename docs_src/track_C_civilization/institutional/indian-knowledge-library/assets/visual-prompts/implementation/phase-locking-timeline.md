# PHASE LOCKING TIMELINE DIAGRAM PROMPT  
Current Phase Page — Primary Visual

## Purpose

This diagram visually communicates the disciplined advancement model of the project:

Phases are:
• Sequential
• Closed before moving forward
• Non-retroactive
• Structurally locked

This is not a feature roadmap.
It is a phase integrity model.

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create a clean horizontal timeline with three major segments:

Phase 0 — Foundation & Architecture  
Phase 1 — Canonical Reader  
Phase 2 — Canonical Expansion (Active)

Optional faint placeholder segments (greyed out) for:
Phase 3+
Phase 4+
Without detail.
