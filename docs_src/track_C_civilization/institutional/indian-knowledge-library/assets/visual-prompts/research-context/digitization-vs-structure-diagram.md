# DIGITIZATION VS STRUCTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE DIAGRAM PROMPT  
Research & Digital Humanities Page — Supporting Visual

## Purpose

This diagram clarifies the difference between:

Simple Digitization  
and  
Structured Canonical Infrastructure

It must feel academic and analytical.

Not confrontational.
Not dramatic.
Not accusatory.

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create a side-by-side comparison diagram.

LEFT COLUMN TITLE:

LEFT SIDE VISUAL ELEMENTS

• Scanned manuscript image
• PDF icon
• Search bar

Light grey.
Minimal structure.
Flat layout.

RIGHT SIDE VISUAL ELEMENTS

Represent:

• Canonical spine (vertical axis)
• UID tags attached to verses
• Layered rings around a verse (semantic, interpretive, pedagogical)
• Cross-referencing arrows
• Validation shield icon (minimal)

Visual tone:
Soft indigo lines.
Structured alignment.
Symmetry.

## DESIGN STYLE

• Ivory background
• Thin precise linework
• Clean serif typography
• No gradients
• No 3D
• No dramatic contrast
• No glowing effects
• No aggressive red/green comparison

Both sides should look calm.
Right side should simply look more structured.

## VISUAL MESSAGE

Digitization increases access.
Structure ensures continuity.

Access without structure is fragile.
Structure without access is incomplete.

## OUTPUT

Wide horizontal format preferred.
High resolution.
Vector clarity.
Minimalist academic aesthetic.
