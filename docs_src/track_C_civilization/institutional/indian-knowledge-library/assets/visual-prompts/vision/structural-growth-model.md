# STRUCTURAL GROWTH MODEL — VISUAL PROMPT  
Long-Term Vision

## Purpose

This diagram represents the architectural expansion model
of the Indian Knowledge Library.

It must communicate:

Growth occurs through structural locking.
Each phase rests securely upon completed foundations.

This is not a timeline.
It is an architectural elevation model.

---

## CORE STRUCTURE

Design a stepped foundation model, vertical orientation.

Bottom to Top:

Foundation Block — Phase 0  
Canonical Reader Layer — Phase 1  
Canonical Expansion Layer — Phase 2  
Knowledge Layer Integration — Phase 3  
Educational Framework Layer — Phase 4  
Guidance & Community Layer — Phase 5  
Future Layers — Open Extension  

Each layer is a horizontal stone-like block,
stacked upward in stepped form.

Each block must appear solid and stable.

No arrows.
No dynamic movement.
No progress bar visuals.

---

## LABELING STYLE

Each block labeled clearly:

Phase 0 — Architectural Foundation  
Phase 1 — Canonical Reader Validation  
Phase 2 — Canonical Expansion  
Phase 3 — Knowledge Layer Modeling  
Phase 4 — Structured Education  
Phase 5 — Guidance & Community  
Future — Expansion Under Governance  

Keep labels small and centered.

## COLOR LANGUAGE

• Foundation (Phase 0): Deep muted indigo  
• Middle Layers: Gradual lightening neutral tones  
• Future Layer: Soft translucent grey  

No bright colors.
No gradients.
No shadows.
No glow.

Flat academic architectural style.

## BACKGROUND

Ivory.
Minimal.
No texture.

---

## TYPOGRAPHY

Serif.
Elegant.
Minimal.

---

## VISUAL MESSAGE

Stability precedes expansion.

Locked layers support future growth.

---

## CAPTION BELOW

Architectural expansion through disciplined phase locking.

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Vertical orientation.
High resolution.
Vector clarity.
Minimalist academic aesthetic.
No corporate infographic style.
No startup roadmap appearance.
