# SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE STACK DIAGRAM PROMPT  
Technical Architecture Overview — Primary Visual

## Purpose

This diagram visually represents the layered system architecture of the Indian Knowledge Library.

It must clearly communicate:

• Layer separation  
• Downward dependency  
• Governance enforcement  
• Canonical foundation  

It must feel engineered.
Not conceptual art.

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create a clean vertical stacked architecture diagram with four main layers.

Bottom Layer (Foundation — Thickest):
CANONICAL DATA LAYER

Above:
SEMANTIC & INTERPRETIVE DATA LAYER

Above:
APPLICATION & PRESENTATION LAYER

Top (Narrower band or side overlay):
GOVERNANCE & VALIDATION LAYER

---

## INTERNAL LABELS

CANONICAL DATA LAYER:
• UID-bound
• Spine-declared
• Schema-validated
• Immutable

SEMANTIC & INTERPRETIVE LAYER:
• Translation
• Commentary
• Entities
• Metadata

APPLICATION LAYER:
• UI Rendering
• Search
• Navigation
• User Interaction

GOVERNANCE LAYER:
• Validators
• Schema Enforcement
• AI Boundaries
• Version Control

---

## VISUAL STRUCTURE

• Rectangular containment blocks
• Thin indigo structural lines
• Muted gold highlights for foundation layer
• Light grey separation lines between layers

Add subtle downward arrows between layers labeled:
"Dependency"

Add subtle side bracket on right labeled:
"Architectural Enforcement"

---

## DESIGN STYLE

• Ivory background
• Clean serif typography
• No gradients
• No drop shadows
• No 3D perspective
• No database icons
• No cloud icons
• No tech motifs
• No glowing effects

Minimalist academic architecture diagram.

## VISUAL MESSAGE

Structure enforces discipline.
Layers prevent collapse.
Governance protects foundation.

---

## OUTPUT

High resolution.
Vertical orientation preferred.
Vector clarity.
Clean professional tone.
