# CANONICAL IDENTITY — GRAVITATIONAL MODEL

## Purpose

Identity must feel central, weighted, and stable.

The outer layers must feel lighter.

---

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create concentric circular diagram.

Center circle:
Canonical Identity

Make center slightly smaller than current version,
but visually heavier.

Use deep indigo fill.
Thin gold outline.
Very subtle inner shadow.

---

Surrounding rings:

Interpretive Layer
Pedagogical Layer
Community Layer

But add one refinement:

Make ring thickness gradually thinner outward.

Inner rings thicker.
Outer rings thinner.

This creates gravitational perception.

---

## VISUAL DYNAMICS

Add very subtle radial gradient in background —
barely visible — drawing eye toward center.

No glow.
No halo.
No drop shadows.

Just tonal gravity.

---

## TYPOGRAPHY

Center:
White serif.
Slight letter-spacing.

Outer rings:
Muted indigo-grey text.

---

## VISUAL MESSAGE

Identity holds.
Layers orbit.

---

## CAPTION

Canonical identity remains structurally unchanged as layers accumulate.

---

Square format.
Academic vector style.
No infographic arrows.
No corporate UI aesthetic.
