# SPINE DECLARATION DIAGRAM  
Canonical Structure Derivation Model

## Purpose

This diagram visually explains how canonical identity is derived.

It must communicate:

Structure precedes identity.
Identity derives from declared spine.
Units inherit stability from structural hierarchy.

No decorative elements.
No infographic arrows.
No 3D effects.

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Create a vertically aligned structural flow diagram with four tiers:

TIER 1 (Top)
Textual Work
Example label:
Mahābhārata

Represent as a simple rectangular block.
Soft beige fill.
Thin indigo border.

---

TIER 2
Declared Canonical Spine
Example label:
Parva → Adhyāya → Verse

Represent as structured stacked block.
Slightly narrower than Tier 1.
Muted indigo outline.

Add very subtle connector line from Tier 1.

---

TIER 3
UID Derivation Layer
Example label:
mbh.1.1.1

Represent as centered compact block.
Deeper indigo background.
White serif text.
Thin gold border (very subtle).

Connector lines thin and straight.

---

TIER 4 (Bottom)
Canonical Units
Example labels:
Verse 1  
Verse 2  
Verse 3  

Represent as three aligned blocks side-by-side.
Soft neutral fill.
Thin indigo border.

---

## Layout

Vertical alignment.
Even spacing.
No arrows.
Use thin straight connector lines only.

No glow.
No drop shadows.
No gradients.

---

## Color Discipline

Background: Ivory  
Structural lines: Muted indigo  
UID block: Deep indigo  
Accent: Very thin gold outline around UID block only  

---

## Visual Message

A work does not directly produce identity.

Identity is mediated through declared structure.

---

## Caption

Canonical identity derives from declared structural spine — not from edition formatting.

---

High resolution.
Flat vector.
Academic architectural tone.
No tech UI style.
