# HERO SECTION

[HERO_BACKGROUND_IMAGE]

Title:
INDIAN KNOWLEDGE LIBRARY

Subtitle:
A Canonical Identity–Driven Digital Infrastructure for Indian Śāstric Knowledge

Supporting Line:
Preservation. Structure. Research. Education. Continuity.

Introduction (5 lines maximum):

The Indian Knowledge Library is a long-term civilizational infrastructure initiative dedicated to structurally preserving and coherently organizing the vast corpus of Indian śāstric traditions.  
It is built upon canonical identity stability, edition-agnostic structural discipline, and a layered knowledge model that enables research, education, guidance, and living application without compromising textual integrity.

Core Signals (minimal inline separators):

Verse-level canonical identity  
Edition-independent structural spine  
Layered knowledge architecture

# SECTION I — THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEM

Headline:
From Richness to Fragmentation

Across centuries, Indian śāstra evolved through layered commentary, diverse regional editions, and multiple traditions of transmission.

In the digital age, this richness risks fragmentation unless anchored by structural identity discipline.

Four Structured Blocks:

• Edition Variability  
Numbering inconsistencies and textual divergence complicate digital coherence.

• Canonical–Commentary Mixing  
Digital systems often blur primary text and interpretation.

• Research Non-Standardization  
Lack of stable identifiers limits large-scale academic modeling.

• Applied Disconnect  
Without structural layering, knowledge struggles to integrate into education and community systems.

Closing line (centered):

The solution is not digitization alone — it is canonical infrastructure.

# SECTION II — THE SCALE OF THE CORPUS

[CORPUS_TREE_IMAGE]

Headline:
The Vastness of the Śāstric Universe

Indian knowledge traditions span multiple structural domains:

Śruti  
Smṛti  
Itihāsa  
Purāṇa  
Āgama / Tantra  
Vedāṅga  
Upaveda  
Darśana  
Sampradāya Traditions  

The challenge is not preservation alone —  
it is maintaining structural coherence across the entire civilizational spectrum.

# SECTION III — THE ARCHITECTURAL BREAKTHROUGH

Headline:
Canonical Identity as Foundational Infrastructure

Identity is structural, not interpretive.

Each canonical unit:

• Is anchored by stable UID  
• Derives from a declared structural spine  
• Remains edition-independent  
• Accepts layered attachment without modification

Caption:
Identity remains stable as knowledge expands outward.

# SECTION IV — THE FOUR PILLARS FRAMEWORK

Headline:
From Archive to Living Knowledge System

Four horizontal panels:

1. Canonical Digital Infrastructure  
Spine-based, UID-anchored corpus foundation.

2. Structured Education Framework  
Age-stage pathways, curriculum modeling, disciplined learning architecture.

3. Applied Guidance Mapping  
Context-aware application across life situations and domains.

4. Living Civilizational Model  
Integration across social, economic, cultural, and institutional layers.

Each panel links to its detailed page.

Alternate background: subtle saffron tint (5% only).

# SECTION V — ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRITY

Headline:
Governance & Structural Discipline

Four Compact Blocks:

• Canonical Spine Declaration  
Explicit structural backbone per work.

• UID & Schema Enforcement  
Machine-parsable stability.

• Knowledge Layer Separation  
Interpretation without contamination.

• AI Governance Safeguards  
Assistance without authority.

Tone:
Engineering clarity.
Institutional composure.

# SECTION VI — CURRENT STATUS

Headline:
Phase 2 — Canonical Expansion

The constitutional foundation is locked.

The canonical reader architecture is validated.

UID systems are active.

Structured ingestion of additional śāstra is underway.

Knowledge, education, and community layers are architecturally defined and will be introduced progressively in later phases.

Growth is phased.
Foundations are not rewritten.

---

# SECTION VII — ACADEMIC INVITATION

Headline:
An Open Infrastructure for Structured Research

The project welcomes collaboration from:

• Indian Knowledge Systems scholars  
• Sanskrit researchers  
• Digital humanities laboratories  
• Information architects  
• Ethical AI researchers  
• Interdisciplinary civilizational studies groups  

Indian Knowledge Library is designed not as a platform,
but as durable infrastructure —
intended to serve generations of readers and researchers.
