# LOVEABLE PROMPT — CURRENT PHASE & IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
Indian Knowledge Library — Implementation Section

Design a structured academic page titled:

"Current Phase & Implementation Status"

Maintain consistent design language:
• Ivory background
• Serif headings
• Indigo accents
• Muted gold highlights
• Calm whitespace
• No marketing tone

This page must communicate credibility through restraint.

## HERO SECTION

Title:
Current Phase & Implementation Status

Subtitle:
Building Structure Before Expansion

Intro Paragraph:

The Indian Knowledge Library advances by defined phases.

Each phase is completed and locked
before the next begins.

This ensures structural stability,
architectural clarity,
and long-term integrity.

---

## SECTION 1 — COMPLETED PHASES

Heading:
Completed & Locked

Display two structured cards:

Card 1:
Phase 0 — Foundation & Architecture
• Project Constitution declared
• Canonical identity framework defined
• UID system formalized
• Spine declaration model established
• Schema contracts written
• Governance hierarchy locked

Card 2:
Phase 1 — Canonical Reader Pilot
• Bhagavad-gītā implemented
• Verse-level navigation
• Devanāgarī + IAST
• Word-by-word layer
• Multi-language translations
• Calm reading interface validated

Below cards, add:

Once locked, phases are not retroactively altered.

---

## VISUAL PLACEHOLDER — PHASE TIMELINE

Insert horizontal minimal timeline diagram:

Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 (Active)

Caption:
Advancement through locking, not iteration.

---

## SECTION 2 — CURRENT PHASE (ACTIVE)

Heading:
Phase 2 — Canonical Expansion

Content:

Current work focuses exclusively on:

• Canonical ingestion of additional śāstra  
• Validation of multiple canonical unit types  
• Stress-testing UID grammar  
• Refinement of canonical spine declarations  
• Pipeline standardization  

Deliberately excluded:

• Commentary comparison tools  
• AI interpretation features  
• Community modules  
• Monetization systems  
• Platform expansion  

Expansion without stability is avoided.

---

## SECTION 3 — WHY RESTRAINT MATTERS

Heading:
Why Not Build Everything at Once?

Content:

Large knowledge systems fail when:

• Features outrun foundations  
• UI decisions redefine structure  
• Interpretation alters identity  
• Scale precedes stability  

The Indian Knowledge Library proceeds in the opposite order:

Structure first.  
Growth later.

---

## SECTION 4 — TRANSPARENCY & DOCUMENTATION

Heading:
Open Architectural Documentation

Content:

All core documents are versioned and structured.

Authority is declared by:

• Constitutional documents  
• Phase status reports  
• Architectural contracts  
• Schema definitions  

The system is documented to remain stable across decades —
not just releases.

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Centered block:

The project advances by phases, not by patches.  
What is locked remains locked.
