# LOVEABLE PROMPT — PHASE ROADMAP & EXPANSION VISION
Indian Knowledge Library — Implementation Section

Design a structured academic page titled:

"Phase Roadmap & Expansion Vision"

Maintain established visual language:
• Ivory background
• Serif headings
• Indigo accents
• Muted gold highlights
• Calm spacing
• No timelines with dates
• No growth projections
• No marketing claims

This page describes structural evolution — not product scaling.

## HERO SECTION

Title:
Phase Roadmap & Expansion Vision

Subtitle:
Expansion Anchored in Structure

Intro Paragraph:

The Indian Knowledge Library does not expand by feature accumulation.

It expands by structural readiness.

Each future phase builds upon locked foundations —
without reopening them.

---

## SECTION 1 — PHASE 3 (INTERPRETIVE STABILITY)

Heading:
Phase 3 — Interpretive Layer Stabilization

Focus:

• Commentary attachment architecture  
• Multi-ācārya comparison framework  
• Semantic derivation validation  
• Non-intrusive UI expansion  

Principle:

Interpretation must attach to canon —
without altering canonical identity.

---

## SECTION 2 — PHASE 4 (EDUCATIONAL STRUCTURING)

Heading:
Phase 4 — Structured Educational Layer

Focus:

• Curriculum modeling  
• Learning pathways  
• Thematic clustering  
• Skill-oriented structuring  

Principle:

Education organizes meaning —
without redefining identity.

---

## SECTION 3 — PHASE 5 (GUIDANCE MAPPING)

Heading:
Phase 5 — Applied Guidance Framework

Focus:

• Situation-to-verse mapping  
• Domain classification  
• Principle extraction  
• Decision-context modeling  

Principle:

Application must trace back to canonical reference.

---

## SECTION 4 — PHASE 6 (COMMUNITY LAYER)

Heading:
Phase 6 — Community & Living Knowledge

Focus:

• Discussion spaces  
• Structured annotation  
• Moderated reflection  
• Contextual commentary  

Principle:

Community engagement remains layered —
never canonical.

## VISUAL PLACEHOLDER — STRUCTURAL GROWTH MODEL

Insert diagram showing:

Core Canonical Foundation
Growing concentric layers outward
Each layer labeled by phase

Caption:
Expansion without destabilization.

## SECTION 5 — LONG-TERM HORIZON

Heading:
Long-Term Horizon

Content:

Over time, the system may support:

• Full Vedic corpus integration  
• Multi-traditional commentarial ecosystems  
• Cross-śāstra thematic mapping  
• Research-grade citation infrastructure  
• Institutional curriculum integration  

The goal is continuity —
not acceleration.

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Centered block:

Structure first.  
Expansion second.  
Continuity always.
