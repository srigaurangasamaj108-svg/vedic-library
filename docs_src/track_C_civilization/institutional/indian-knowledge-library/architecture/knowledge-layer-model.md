## HERO SECTION

Title:
Knowledge Layer Model

Subtitle:
From Canonical Preservation to Living Application

Intro Paragraph:

Not all knowledge is the same kind of knowledge.

Śāstra itself distinguishes between:

• Text  
• Meaning  
• Principle  
• Application  
• Realization  

Digital systems must preserve these distinctions —
without collapsing them.
