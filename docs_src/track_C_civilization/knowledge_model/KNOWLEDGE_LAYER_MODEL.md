This document explains how all meaning-bearing layers in the Vedic Library relate to each other, without collapsing canon, commentary, pedagogy, or community knowledge.

It is intentionally slow, explicit, and architectural.

🧠 Knowledge Layer Model
Vedic Library Project
0. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the Knowledge Layer Model of the Vedic Library.

It answers:

What layers of knowledge exist in the system?

How do they relate to canonical text?

How do they relate to each other?

What is allowed to depend on what?

How does the system scale from reading → study → application → community?

This document is conceptual and architectural, not a schema.

1. Foundational Insight

Not all knowledge is the same kind of knowledge.

Śāstra itself already recognizes layers:

śabda (text)

artha (meaning)

tattva (principle)

prayoga (application)

anubhava (lived realization)

The Vedic Library models this explicitly.

2. The Five Major Knowledge Layers

The entire system is organized into five stacked layers.

┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ 5. Community & Living Layer  │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. Pedagogical Layer         │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. Interpretive Layer        │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. Semantic Layer            │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Canonical Layer           │
└──────────────────────────────┘


Each layer:

depends only on layers below it

never modifies layers below it

may be removed without breaking lower layers

3. Layer 1 — Canonical Layer (Foundation)
Definition

The Canonical Layer contains primary śāstric units exactly as preserved.

Examples:

verses (śloka)

sūtras

mantras

prose units

Characteristics:

immutable

language-locked

interpretation-free

schema-bound

UID-anchored

This layer answers:

“What is actually said in the śāstra?”

4. Layer 2 — Semantic Layer (Meaning Units)
Definition

The Semantic Layer contains atomic units of meaning directly derived from canon.

Examples:

word meanings

translations

glosses

entities (persons, places)

concepts

principles

Characteristics:

one-to-many with canon

explicitly attributed

removable

non-authoritative by default

This layer answers:

“What does this text mean?”

5. Layer 3 — Interpretive Layer (Viewpoints)
Definition

The Interpretive Layer contains coherent explanatory positions.

Examples:

commentaries

philosophical explanations

sampradāya readings

comparative interpretations

Characteristics:

may disagree internally

may span multiple verses

explicitly attributed to traditions or authors

never canonical

This layer answers:

“How is this understood within a tradition?”

6. Layer 4 — Pedagogical Layer (Teaching & Use)
Definition

The Pedagogical Layer organizes knowledge for learning and application.

Examples:

lessons

courses

learning paths

skill tracks

thematic compilations

Characteristics:

intentionally selective

audience-oriented

goal-driven

mutable

This layer answers:

“How should this be taught or practiced?”

7. Layer 5 — Community & Living Layer
Definition

The Community Layer contains living engagement with the text.

Examples:

discussions

reflections

Q&A

shared practices

annotations (non-authoritative)

Characteristics:

subjective

time-bound

contextual

socially moderated

This layer answers:

“How is this text being lived and discussed now?”

8. Dependency Rules (Critical)

The allowed dependency graph is strictly one-directional:

Canonical
   ↑
Semantic
   ↑
Interpretive
   ↑
Pedagogical
   ↑
Community

Forbidden Dependencies

❌ Canonical depending on meaning
❌ Semantic depending on pedagogy
❌ Commentary rewriting canon
❌ Community redefining doctrine

9. Knowledge Unit Types (Cross-Layer)

Some knowledge units span layers but change form.

Example: “Detachment from bodily identity”

Layer	Representation
Canonical	śloka
Semantic	principle
Interpretive	Gauḍīya explanation
Pedagogical	lesson
Community	discussion

Each is a different unit, not the same object reused.

10. Authority Flow

Authority decreases as we move upward.

Layer	Authority Type
Canonical	Absolute
Semantic	Referential
Interpretive	Traditional
Pedagogical	Contextual
Community	Experiential

No upper layer can override a lower one.

11. AI Placement in the Model

AI may operate in:

Semantic layer (translations, glosses)

Interpretive layer (explanations)

Pedagogical layer (lesson drafting)

Community layer (facilitation)

AI never:

edits canon

claims authority

resolves doctrinal disputes

12. Scaling Across the Entire Corpus

This model works equally for:

Bhagavad-gītā

Upaniṣads

Dharmaśāstra

Purāṇas

Tantra

Vedāṅga

Sampradāya texts

Only canonical unit type changes, not the layer model.

13. Why This Model Matters

Without this model:

canon gets diluted

pedagogy masquerades as doctrine

commentary ossifies

community opinion gains false authority

With this model:

clarity is preserved

disagreement is safe

growth is structured

tradition remains alive

14. Relationship to Other Documents

This document integrates with:

CANONICAL_TEXT_POLICY.md

SEMANTIC_DERIVATION_POLICY.md

EDITORIAL_UNIT_DEFINITION.md

CANONICAL_UNIT_DEFINITION.md

VERSE_REFERENCE_CONTRACT.md

If conflict arises:

Canonical Layer + Text Policy always prevail.

15. Status & Evolution

Category: EVOLVING ARCHITECTURE (Versioned)

May evolve when:

new learning modes appear

new community structures arise

Canonical & identity rules remain unchanged

16. Closing Insight

Canon preserves truth.
Meaning unfolds it.
Teaching transmits it.
Community lives it.

The Knowledge Layer Model keeps these distinct — and harmonious.
