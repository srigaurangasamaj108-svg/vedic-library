    "content": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not accept the proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can hardly achieve success in self-realization. Trying to practice\n\nyoga\n\nwhile engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it.\n\nYoga\n\npractice without mental control is a waste of time. Such a show of\n\nyoga\n\nmay be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as spiritual realization is concerned. Therefore, one must control the mind by engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless one is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person easily achieves the result of\n\nyoga\n\npractice without separate endeavor, but a\n\nyoga\n\npractitioner cannot achieve success without becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious."
