    "content": "The words\n\npraśaste karmaṇi,\n\nor “prescribed duties,” indicate that there are many activities prescribed in the Vedic literature which are purificatory processes, beginning from the time of conception up to the end of one’s life. Such purificatory processes are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the living entity. In all such activities it is recommended that one vibrate\n\noṁ tat sat.\n\nThe words\n\nsad-bhāve\n\nand\n\nsādhu-bhāve\n\nindicate the transcendental situation. Acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is called\n\nsattva,\n\nand one who is fully conscious of the activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is called a\n\nsādhu.\n\nIn the\n\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\n\n(3.25.25)\n\nit is said that the transcendental subject matter becomes clear in the association of the devotees. The words used are\n\nsatāṁ prasaṅgāt.\n\nWithout good association, one cannot achieve transcendental knowledge. When initiating a person or offering the sacred thread, one vibrates the words\n\noṁ tat sat.\n\nSimilarly, in all kinds of performance of\n\nyajña\n\nthe object is the Supreme,\n\noṁ tat sat.\n\nThe word\n\ntad-arthīyam\n\nfurther means offering service to anything which represents the Supreme, including such service as cooking and helping in the Lord’s temple, or any other kind of work for broadcasting the glories of the Lord. These supreme words\n\noṁ tat sat\n\nare thus used in many ways to perfect all activities and make everything complete."
