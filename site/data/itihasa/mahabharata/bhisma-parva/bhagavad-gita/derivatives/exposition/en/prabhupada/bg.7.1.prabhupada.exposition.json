    "content": "In this Seventh Chapter of\n\nBhagavad-gītā,\n\nthe nature of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is fully described. Kṛṣṇa is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become attached to Kṛṣṇa and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to Kṛṣṇa are described in this chapter.\n\nIn the first six chapters of\n\nBhagavad-gītā,\n\nthe living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul capable of elevating himself to self-realization by different types of\n\nyogas.\n\nAt the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon Kṛṣṇa, or in other words Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is the highest form of all\n\nyoga.\n\nBy concentrating one’s mind upon Kṛṣṇa, one is able to know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise. Impersonal\n\nbrahma-jyotir\n\nor localized Paramātmā realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth, because it is partial. Full and scientific knowledge is Kṛṣṇa, and everything is revealed to the person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In complete Kṛṣṇa consciousness one knows that Kṛṣṇa is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of\n\nyoga\n\nare only steppingstones on the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One who takes directly to Kṛṣṇa consciousness automatically knows about\n\nbrahma-jyotir\n\nand Paramātmā in full. By practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness\n\nyoga,\n\none can know everything in full – namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.\n\nOne should therefore begin\n\nyoga\n\npractice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon Kṛṣṇa the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which\n\nśravaṇam\n\nis the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna,\n\ntac chṛṇu,\n\nor “Hear from Me.” No one can be a greater authority than Kṛṣṇa, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity to become a perfectly Kṛṣṇa conscious person. One has therefore to learn from Kṛṣṇa directly or from a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa – and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education.\n\nIn the\n\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\n\nthis process of understanding Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows:\n\nśṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ\n\npuṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ\n\nhṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi\n\nvidhunoti suhṛt satām\n\nnaṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu\n\nnityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā\n\nbhagavaty uttama-śloke\n\nbhaktir bhavati naiṣṭhikī\n\ntadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ\n\nkāma-lobhādayaś ca ye\n\nceta etair anāviddhaṁ\n\nsthitaṁ sattve prasīdati\n\nevaṁ prasanna-manaso\n\nbhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ\n\nbhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ\n\nmukta-saṅgasya jāyate\n\nbhidyate hṛdaya-granthiś\n\nchidyante sarva-saṁśayāḥ\n\nkṣīyante cāsya karmāṇi\n\ndṛṣṭa evātmanīśvare\n\n“To hear about Kṛṣṇa from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through the\n\nBhagavad-gītā,\n\nis itself righteous activity. And for one who hears about Kṛṣṇa, Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is dwelling in everyone’s heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about Kṛṣṇa from the\n\nBhāgavatam\n\nand from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus\n\nbhakti-yoga\n\nsevers the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of\n\nasaṁśayaṁ samagram,\n\nunderstanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead.” (\n\nBhāg.\n\n1.2.17–21) Therefore only by hearing from Kṛṣṇa or from His devotee in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can one understand the science of Kṛṣṇa."
