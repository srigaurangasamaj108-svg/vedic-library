    "content": "In this verse it is clearly stated that at the time of death the mind must be fixed in devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those practiced in\n\nyoga,\n\nit is recommended that they raise the life force between the eyebrows (to the\n\nājñā-cakra\n\n). The practice of\n\nṣaṭ-cakra-yoga,\n\ninvolving meditation on the six\n\ncakras,\n\nis suggested here. A pure devotee does not practice such\n\nyoga,\n\nbut because he is always engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, at death he can remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead by His grace. This is explained in verse 14.\n\nThe particular use of the word\n\nyoga-balena\n\nis significant in this verse because without practice of\n\nyoga\n\n– whether\n\nṣaṭ-cakra-yoga\n\nor\n\nbhakti-yoga\n\n– one cannot come to this transcendental state of being at the time of death. One cannot suddenly remember the Supreme Lord at death; one must have practiced some\n\nyoga\n\nsystem, especially the system of\n\nbhakti-yoga.\n\nSince one’s mind at death is very disturbed, one should practice transcendence through\n\nyoga\n\nduring one’s life."
