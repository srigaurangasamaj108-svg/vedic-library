    "content": "One who is unable to live for a moment without Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot but think of Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours a day, being engaged in devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, rendering other services, cultivating friendship and surrendering fully to the Lord. Such activities are all auspicious and full of spiritual potencies, which make the devotee perfect in self-realization, so that his only desire is to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee undoubtedly approaches the Lord without difficulty. This is called\n\nyoga.\n\nBy the mercy of the Lord, such a devotee never comes back to this material condition of life.\n\nKṣema\n\nrefers to the merciful protection of the Lord. The Lord helps the devotee to achieve Kṛṣṇa consciousness by\n\nyoga,\n\nand when he becomes fully Kṛṣṇa conscious the Lord protects him from falling down to a miserable conditioned life."
