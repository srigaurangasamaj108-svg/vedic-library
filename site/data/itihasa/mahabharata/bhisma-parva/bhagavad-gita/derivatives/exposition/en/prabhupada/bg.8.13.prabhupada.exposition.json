    "content": "It is clearly stated here that\n\noṁ,\n\nBrahman and Lord Kṛṣṇa are not different. The impersonal sound of Kṛṣṇa is\n\noṁ,\n\nbut the sound Hare Kṛṣṇa contains\n\noṁ.\n\nThe chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa\n\nmantra\n\nis clearly recommended for this age. So if one quits his body at the end of life chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, he certainly reaches one of the spiritual planets, according to the mode of his practice. The devotees of Kṛṣṇa enter the Kṛṣṇa planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana. For the personalists there are also innumerable other planets, known as Vaikuṇṭha planets, in the spiritual sky, whereas the impersonalists remain in the\n\nbrahma-jyotir\n\n."
