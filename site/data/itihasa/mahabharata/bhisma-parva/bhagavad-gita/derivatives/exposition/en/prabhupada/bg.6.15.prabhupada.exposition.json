    "content": "The ultimate goal in practicing\n\nyoga\n\nis now clearly explained.\n\nYoga\n\npractice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no\n\nyogī\n\naccording to\n\nBhagavad-gītā.\n\nNor does cessation of material existence entail one’s entering into “the void,” which is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly described in the\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nas that place where there is no need of sun, moon or electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called\n\nparaṁ dhāma,\n\nor superior abodes.\n\nA consummate\n\nyogī,\n\nwho is perfect in understanding Lord Kṛṣṇa, as is clearly stated herein by the Lord Himself (\n\nmat-cittaḥ, mat-paraḥ, mat-sthānam\n\n), can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, Kṛṣṇaloka, known as Goloka Vṛndāvana. In the\n\nBrahma-saṁhitā\n\n(5.37)\n\nit is clearly stated,\n\ngoloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ:\n\nthe Lord, although residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Paramātmā as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual sky (Vaikuṇṭha) or enter into the Lord’s eternal abode (Goloka Vṛndāvana) without the proper understanding of Kṛṣṇa and His plenary expansion Viṣṇu. Therefore a person working in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the perfect\n\nyogī,\n\nbecause his mind is always absorbed in Kṛṣṇa’s activities (\n\nsa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ\n\n). In the\n\nVedas\n\nalso (\n\nŚvetāśvatara Upaniṣad\n\n3.8) we learn,\n\ntam eva viditvāti mṛtyum eti:\n\n“One can overcome the path of birth and death only by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.” In other words, perfection of the\n\nyoga\n\nsystem is the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some magical jugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people."
