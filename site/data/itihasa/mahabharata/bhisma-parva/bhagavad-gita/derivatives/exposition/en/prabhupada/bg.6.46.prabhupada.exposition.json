    "content": "When we speak of\n\nyoga\n\nwe refer to linking our consciousness with the Supreme Absolute Truth. Such a process is named differently by various practitioners in terms of the particular method adopted. When the linking process is predominantly in fruitive activities it is called\n\nkarma-yoga,\n\nwhen it is predominantly empirical it is called\n\njñāna-yoga,\n\nand when it is predominantly in a devotional relationship with the Supreme Lord it is called\n\nbhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga,\n\nor Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is the ultimate perfection of all\n\nyogas,\n\nas will be explained in the next verse. The Lord has confirmed herein the superiority of\n\nyoga,\n\nbut He has not mentioned that it is better than\n\nbhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga\n\nis full spiritual knowledge, and therefore nothing can excel it. Asceticism without self-knowledge is imperfect. Empiric knowledge without surrender to the Supreme Lord is also imperfect. And fruitive work without Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a waste of time. Therefore, the most highly praised form of\n\nyoga\n\nperformance mentioned here is\n\nbhakti-yoga,\n\nand this is still more clearly explained in the next verse."
