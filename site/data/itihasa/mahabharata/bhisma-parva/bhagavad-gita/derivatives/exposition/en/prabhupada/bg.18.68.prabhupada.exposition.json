Those who do not accept Kṛṣṇa as He is and\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nas it is should not try to explain\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nwhimsically and become offenders.\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nshould be explained to persons who are ready to accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nas it is will advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead."
