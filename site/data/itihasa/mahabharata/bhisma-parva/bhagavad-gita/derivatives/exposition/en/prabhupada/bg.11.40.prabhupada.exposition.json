He is accepting that He is the master of all potencies and all prowess and far superior to all the great warriors assembled on the battlefield. It is said in the\n\nViṣṇu Purāṇa\n\n(1.9.69):\n\nyo ’yaṁ tavāgato deva\n\nsamīpaṁ devatā-gaṇaḥ\n\nsa tvam eva jagat-sraṣṭā\n\nyataḥ sarva-gato bhavān\n\n“Whoever comes before You, even if he be a demigod, is created by You, O Supreme Personality of Godhead.”"
