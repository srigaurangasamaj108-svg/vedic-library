    "content": "A-kāra,\n\nthe first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, is the beginning of the Vedic literature. Without\n\na-kāra,\n\nnothing can be sounded; therefore it is the beginning of sound. In Sanskrit there are also many compound words, of which the dual word, like\n\nrāma-kṛṣṇa,\n\nis called\n\ndvandva.\n\nIn this compound, the words\n\nrāma\n\nand\n\nkṛṣṇa\n\nhave the same form, and therefore the compound is called dual.\n\nAmong all kinds of killers, time is the ultimate because time kills everything. Time is the representative of Kṛṣṇa because in due course of time there will be a great fire and everything will be annihilated.\n\nAmong the living entities who are creators, Brahmā, who has four heads, is the chief. Therefore he is a representative of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa."
