One cannot remain in the quality of Brahman, the Absolute, until one’s mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord.\n\nSa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ.\n\nTo be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, or to remain in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is to be factually liberated from the mode of passion and all material contamination."
