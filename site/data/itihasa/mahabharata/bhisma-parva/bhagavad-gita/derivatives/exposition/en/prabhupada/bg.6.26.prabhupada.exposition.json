    "content": "The nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady. But a self-realized\n\nyogī\n\nhas to control the mind; the mind should not control him. One who controls the mind (and therefore the senses as well) is called\n\ngosvāmī,\n\nor\n\nsvāmī,\n\nand one who is controlled by the mind is called\n\ngo-dāsa,\n\nor the servant of the senses. A\n\ngosvāmī\n\nknows the standard of sense happiness. In transcendental sense happiness, the senses are engaged in the service of Hṛṣīkeśa, or the supreme owner of the senses – Kṛṣṇa. Serving Kṛṣṇa with purified senses is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the way of bringing the senses under full control. What is more, that is the highest perfection of\n\nyoga\n\npractice."
