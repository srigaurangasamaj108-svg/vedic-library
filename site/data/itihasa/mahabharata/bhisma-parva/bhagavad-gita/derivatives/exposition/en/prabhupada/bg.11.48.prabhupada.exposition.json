    "content": "The divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who can have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Viṣṇu are demigods (\n\nviṣṇu-bhaktaḥ smṛto daivaḥ\n\n). Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Viṣṇu, or who recognize only the impersonal part of Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry Kṛṣṇa and at the same time have the divine vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.\n\nThe\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\ngives the description of the universal form. Although this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna, now one can have some idea of the\n\nviśva-rūpa\n\nafter this incident. Those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested in seeing the universal form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord Kṛṣṇa as Viṣṇu, and he was actually afraid of the universal form.\n\nIn this verse there are some significant words, just like\n\nveda-yajñādhyayanaiḥ,\n\nwhich refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial regulations.\n\nVeda\n\nrefers to all kinds of Vedic literature, such as the four\n\nVedas\n\n(\n\nṚg, Yajur, Sāma\n\nand\n\nAtharva\n\n) and the eighteen\n\nPurāṇas,\n\nthe\n\nUpaniṣads\n\nand the\n\nVedānta-sūtra.\n\nOne can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there are\n\nsūtras – Kalpa-sūtras\n\nand\n\nMīmāṁsā-sūtras\n\n– for studying the method of sacrifice.\n\nDānaiḥ\n\nrefers to charity which is offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord – the\n\nbrāhmaṇas\n\nand the Vaiṣṇavas. Similarly, “pious activities” refers to the\n\nagni-hotra\n\nand the prescribed duties of the different castes. And the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains is called\n\ntapasya.\n\nSo one can perform all these – can accept bodily penances, give charity, study the\n\nVedas,\n\netc. – but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that universal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nwe understand that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.\n\nThere are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the principles of\n\nBhagavad-gītā,\n\notherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge. Although\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\nis considered the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that it enables one to distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form, but that is unacceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of Kṛṣṇa one cannot see the universal form of God. So one first of all has to become a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa; then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of Kṛṣṇa cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations."
