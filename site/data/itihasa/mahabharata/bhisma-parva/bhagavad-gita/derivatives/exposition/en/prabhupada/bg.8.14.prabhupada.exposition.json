    "content": "This verse especially describes the final destination attained by the unalloyed devotees who serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead in\n\nbhakti-yoga.\n\nPrevious verses have mentioned four different kinds of devotees – the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation have also been described:\n\nkarma-yoga, jñāna-yoga\n\nand\n\nhaṭha-yoga.\n\nThe principles of these\n\nyoga\n\nsystems have some\n\nbhakti\n\nadded, but this verse particularly mentions pure\n\nbhakti-yoga,\n\nwithout any mixture of\n\njñāna, karma\n\nor\n\nhaṭha.\n\nAs indicated by the word\n\nananya-cetāḥ,\n\nin pure\n\nbhakti-yoga\n\nthe devotee desires nothing but Kṛṣṇa. A pure devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek oneness with the\n\nbrahma-jyotir\n\nor salvation or liberation from material entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the\n\nCaitanya-caritāmṛta\n\nthe pure devotee is called\n\nniṣkāma,\n\nwhich means he has no desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. Whereas a\n\njñāna-yogī, karma-yogī\n\nor\n\nhaṭha-yogī\n\nhas his own selfish interests, a perfect devotee has no desire other than to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain.\n\nA pure devotee always engages in devotional service to Kṛṣṇa in one of His various personal features. Kṛṣṇa has various plenary expansions and incarnations, such as Rāma and Nṛsiṁha, and a devotee can choose to fix his mind in loving service to any of these transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord. Such a devotee meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other\n\nyogas. Bhakti-yoga\n\nis very simple and pure and easy to perform. One can begin simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. The Lord is merciful to all, but as we have already explained, He is especially inclined toward those who always serve Him without deviation. The Lord helps such devotees in various ways. As stated in the\n\nVedas\n\n(\n\nKaṭha Upaniṣad\n\n1.2.23),\n\nyam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas/ tasyaiṣa ātmā vivṛṇute tanuṁ svām:\n\none who is fully surrendered and engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord can understand the Supreme Lord as He is. And as stated in\n\nBhagavad-gītā\n\n(10.10)\n\n,\n\ndadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ tam:\n\nthe Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.\n\nThe special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa without deviation and without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like Vṛndāvana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of Vṛndāvana by his devotional service. It was Śrī Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, “Wherever You are, O Lord –\n\nthere\n\nis Vṛndāvana.”\n\nAs indicated by the words\n\nsatatam\n\nand\n\nnityaśaḥ,\n\nwhich mean “always,” “regularly,” or “every day,” a pure devotee constantly remembers Kṛṣṇa and meditates upon Him. These are qualifications of the pure devotee, for whom the Lord is most easily attainable.\n\nBhakti-yoga\n\nis the system that the\n\nGītā\n\nrecommends above all others. Generally, the\n\nbhakti-yogīs\n\nare engaged in five different ways: (1)\n\nśānta-bhakta,\n\nengaged in devotional service in neutrality; (2)\n\ndāsya-bhakta,\n\nengaged in devotional service as servant; (3)\n\nsakhya-bhakta,\n\nengaged as friend; (4)\n\nvātsalya-bhakta,\n\nengaged as parent; and (5)\n\nmādhurya-bhakta,\n\nengaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly the Supreme Lord cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the Kṛṣṇa conscious process of chanting the\n\nmahā-mantra\n\n– Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare."
