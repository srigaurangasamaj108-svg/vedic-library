    "content": "In this chapter Lord Kṛṣṇa answers different questions from Arjuna, beginning with “What is Brahman?” The Lord also explains\n\nkarma\n\n(fruitive activities), devotional service and\n\nyoga\n\nprinciples, and devotional service in its pure form. The\n\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam\n\nexplains that the Supreme Absolute Truth is known as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. In addition, the living entity, the individual soul, is also called Brahman. Arjuna also inquires about\n\nātmā,\n\nwhich refers to body, soul and mind. According to the Vedic dictionary,\n\nātmā\n\nrefers to the mind, soul, body and senses also.\n\nArjuna has addressed the Supreme Lord as Puruṣottama, Supreme Person, which means that he was putting these questions not simply to a friend but to the Supreme Person, knowing Him to be the supreme authority able to give definitive answers."
